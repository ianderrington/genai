Welcome to my Gen(erative) AI repository. 

Here I will document and organize summarizes important research, tools, best practices, and (presently) state of art results and topics related to GPT-enabled technology. Please note that it will _not_ focus on the topic of AI Ethics.  

Please be advised, there are many quality sources out there. If I miss something essential, please file an issue (or a PR).
