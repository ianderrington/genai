Documentation: Detailed documentation of the existing features, setup instructions, and how to contribute. This is crucial as it not only serves as a guide for users and contributors but also demonstrates your ability to manage and present a complex project. Demonstrated Use Case:</p> <p>Working Example: Include at least one working example in your repository that clearly demonstrates the project's current capabilities. This could be a case study or a practical demonstration of the system processing and integrating a document. Visuals and Explanations: Accompany this with visuals (like flowcharts or screenshots) and thorough explanations. This will help in communicating the project's functionality and your technical acumen. Project Roadmap:</p> <p>Clear Roadmap: Outline a clear and detailed roadmap for future development. This should include planned features, enhancements, and areas where community contributions are encouraged. Milestones: Set realistic milestones that show a structured approach to development and indicate opportunities for community involvement. Community Engagement Plan:</p> <p>Contribution Guidelines: Establish clear guidelines for contributions, including coding standards, pull request processes, and issue reporting. Communication Channels: Set up channels for community engagement, such as a project discussion forum, a dedicated Slack or Discord channel, or a mailing list. Personal Reflection:</p> <p>Your Role and Contributions: Clearly articulate your role in the project and your contributions. This is important to highlight your individual skills and leadership in the project's development. Learning and Challenges: Share your learning experience and challenges faced during the initial development phase. This openness adds to your credibility and reflects your problem-solving skills. Timing for Announcement Strategic Timing: Consider announcing your project at a time when it is most likely to get noticed. This could be aligned with major tech events, AI conferences, or relevant community events. Prepare for Feedback: Be ready to receive and respond to feedback upon announcement. Engaging with the initial audience is crucial for building a community and can also lead to valuable insights and improvements.</p> <p>Using Github to organize our understanding of a fluid field is a notable challenge.

Inference: Tokyo is in Japan and the Metropolitan Museum of Art is in New York. The two\nplaces are separated by the sea, so you can\u2019t take a taxi there. Since the two places are separated\nby the sea, you can\u2019t take a taxi there. The answer is yes.\nQ: {question}\n\n**Read the question again**\n_prompt:_\nQ: Mark\u2019s father gave him $85. Mark bought 10 books, each of which cost $5. How much money\ndoes Mark have left?\nA: Let\u2019s think step by step. The question is: How much money does Mark have left? So we need\nto calculate How much money does Mark have left. Start looking for information about money\nnow. Mark\u2019s father gave him $85. Mark bought 10 books, each of which cost $5. That means that\nMark spent $50 on books. So we have equation money = +85 - 50 = 35. So Mark has $85 - $50 =\n$35 left. So the answer is 35.\nQ: {question}\n**Repeat State**\n_prompt:_\nQ: A coin is heads up. Janette does not flip the coin. Stacey flips the coin. Ronny flips the coin.\nKim does not flip the coin.

Janette does not\nflip the coin, so the coin remains heads up. coin is heads up. Stacey flips the coin, so the coin is\nnow tails up. coin is now tail up. Ronny flips the coin, so the coin is now heads up again. Kim\ndoes not flip the coin, so the coin remains heads up. coin is head up.

Explain\nconcatenate: concatenate is a term used in computer programming and mathematics, referring to\nthe operation of combining two or more strings, sequences, or sets in a linear order. The last letter\nof \"Alina\" is \"a\". The last letter of \"Alessandra\" is \"a\". The last letter of \"Amina\" is \"a\". The last\nletter of \"Bianca\" is \"a\". So we have four letters. So the final answer is \"aaaa\". The answer is aaaa.\nQ: {question}\n**Make Equation**\n_prompt:_\nQ: 5 children were riding on the bus.

We know 5 children is on\nthe bus. second step,There were 63 children that got off the bus. third step, some more got on the\nbus we define as unknown x. fourth step, 14 children remained on the bus, which means we can\ncalculate unknow x.we have equation x+5-63 = 14, now we know x is 72. fifth step, Therefore, 72\n- 63 = 9. 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities on a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and the generation of coherent text and code. However, LLMs can struggle with multi-step problems and long-term planning, which are crucial for designing scientific experiments. Moreover, evaluation of the accuracy of scientific protocols is challenging, because experiments can be described correctly in many different ways, require expert knowledge to evaluate, and cannot usually be executed automatically. Here we present an automatic evaluation framework for the task of planning experimental protocols, and we introduce BioProt: a dataset of biology protocols with corresponding pseudocode representations. To measure performance on generating scientific protocols, we use an LLM to convert a natural language protocol into pseudocode, and then evaluate an LLM's ability to reconstruct the pseudocode from a high-level description and a list of admissible pseudocode functions. We evaluate GPT-3 and GPT-4 on this task and explore their robustness. We externally validate the utility of pseudocode representations of text by generating accurate novel protocols using retrieved pseudocode, and we run a generated protocol successfully in our biological laboratory. Our framework is extensible to the evaluation and improvement of language model planning abilities in other areas of science or other areas that lack automatic evaluation.</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/cognitive_architecture.html#branching","title":"Branching","text":"<p>General manners of search. </p> LLMCompiler: An LLM Compiler for Parallel Function Calling provides an useful framework that improves latency, accuracy, and costs by orchestrating parallel calls. <p>Paper This breaks components down into a task-fetching unit and an executor to dynamically identify the tasks that could be executed, performs argument replacements on intermediate results, and an executor that performs function calls provided by the Task-fetching unit.   </p> Toolchain*: Efficient Action Space Navigation in Large Language Models with A* Search provides an efficient tree guided-search algorithm that allows SOT performance <p>As opposed to other branching methods that allow for efficient exploration of action space, helping to find global optimization of a series of LLM calls.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\n'''\n</code></pre> <p>```</p> Teach LLMs to Personalize \u2013 An Approach inspired by Writing Education <p></p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/cognitive_architecture.html#constraining-outputs","title":"Constraining outputs","text":"Certified Reasoning with Language models A 'logical guide' tool that an LLM can use. <p>It \" uses constrained decoding to ensure the model will incrementally generate one of the valid outputs.\"  Possible open-source implementation here</p> Outlines guides the model generation of next-token logits to guide the generation corresponding to regex / JSON and pydantic schema. compatible with all models. <p>Also provides a way to functionalize templates to separate prompt logic.</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/cognitive_architecture.html#automated-chain-discovery-selection-and-creation","title":"Automated chain discovery, selection, and creation.","text":"Auto-CoT: Automatic Chain of Thought Prompting in Large Language Models <p>Paper This algorithm samples exemplars to construct demonstrations that enable improved accuracy of multi-shotted outcomes using the Chain-of-Thought prompting method.  </p> Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning?

For evaluation, we assemble the largest NER benchmark to date, comprising 43 datasets across 9 diverse domains such as biomedicine, programming, social media, law, finance. Without using any direct supervision, UniversalNER attains remarkable NER accuracy across tens of thousands of entity types, outperforming general instruction-tuned models such as Alpaca and Vicuna by over 30 absolute F1 points in average. With a tiny fraction of parameters, UniversalNER not only acquires ChatGPT\u2019s capability in recognizing arbitrary entity types, but also outperforms its NER accuracy by 7-9 absolute F1 points in average. Remarkably, UniversalNER even outperforms by a large margin state-of-the-art multi-task instruction-tuned systems such as InstructUIE, which uses supervised NER examples. We also conduct thorough ablation studies to assess the impact of various components in our distillation approach. We will release the distillation recipe, data, and UniversalNER models to facilitate future research on targeted distillation.\"\n</code></pre> https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03279.pdf https://github.com/universal-ner/universal-ner</p> Suspicion-Agent: Playing imperfect Information Games with Theory of Mind Aware GPT-4 <p>Introduces directly into the prompts a Theory-of-Mind about their awareness and own estimations and will update accordingly.\"  </p> CLIN: A Continually Learning Language Agent for Rapid Task Adaptation and Generalization <p>An agent that stores a memory involving action, rationale, and result so that it can improve doing certain tasks.

However, their success heavily relies on human input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and provide insight into their \"cognitive\" processes. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named role-playing. Our approach involves using inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of chat agents, providing a valuable resource for investigating conversational language models. Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative agents and beyond. \"</p> <p>GitHub: https://github.com/camel-ai/camel</p> <p>Article: https://blog.devgenius.io/coded-example-of-langchain-enabled-cooperative-agents-4859d294b197</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/examples.html#libraries","title":"Libraries","text":"<p>Awesome LLM Powered Agent</p> <p>Robo GPT</p> <p>Chrome-GPT: an experimental AutoGPT agent that interacts with Chrome</p> <p>GPT prompts</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/memory.html","title":"Memory","text":"<p>Agent memory is considered a state associated with a llm-call and effects the ability of LLM to respond, thereby helping to enable agentic ability.

However, their intensive computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters on flash memory but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that harmonizes with the flash memory behavior, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this flash memory-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, \u201cwindowing\u201d strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, \u201crow-column bundling\u201d, tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively.

They recognise entities and produce their attributes as directions. We suggest viewing fact recall as a black box making \"multi-token embeddings. \nOur hope was to understand a circuit in superposition at the parameter level, but we failed at this. We carefully falsify several naive hypotheses, but fact recall seems pretty cursed. We can black box the lookup part, so this doesn't sink the mech interp agenda, but it's a blow.\nImportantly, though we failed to understand *how* MLP neurons look up tokens to attributes, we think that *once* the attributes are looked up, they are interpretable, and there\u2019s important work to be done (eg with Sparse Autoencoders) decoding them. \nWe show that, more generally, early layers specialise in processing nearby tokens, only going long-range in mid-layers. If you truncate the context to the nearest 5-10 tokens and look at similarity of residual streams, it starts high and sharply drops. But it\u2019s not a hard rule. \nDespite the MLP layers being in high superposition, with many distributed or polysemantic neurons, we found a baseball neuron! It was causally relevant and systematically fired for baseball players, though it also did other things on the full data distribution \nTo find the baseball direction we first trained probes, but later found mechanistic probes - the baseball unembed times the OV circuit of key heads, gives a more principled probe, without needing to train one! We think this is a cool technique we\u2019d love to see more work on. \nThis has interesting parallels with \nthis work showing relationship decoding (in fact recall) is a linear map - we speculate that the maps they find are mostly the OV circuits of key attention heads. \nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09124.pdf\nMore generally, linear probes have a lot of promise as a technique for circuit analysis. By layer 6(/32) the sport is known with high accuracy, so it suffices to zoom in on early MLP layers to understand factual recall, rather than needing to understand the full circuit! \nSome weird observations - we'd love to see future work!\nEarly layers do longer-range processing on common words and punctuation, intuitively, it\u2019s easier to figure out meaning without context than for a token in a multi-token word. \nOn random names if you probe for a sport, there\u2019s often a confident (nonsense) answer, but the model doesn\u2019t output this answer. Why? Turns out the fact extractor heads don't look. Their *key* represents if it's an athlete, their value represents the sport, and it does an AND. \"\nFact Finding: Attempting to Reverse-Engineer Factual Recall on the Neuron Level \nhttps://www.alignmentforum.org/.../p/iGuwZTHWb6DFY3sKB\n]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Understanding/studies/studies.html","title":"Studies","text":"<p>We are in an age of experimental applied mathematics.

You can use Cypher statements to retrieve information from a graph database like Neo4j. One option is to use LLMs to generate Cypher statements. While that option provides excellent flexibility, the truth is that base LLMs are still brittle at consistently generating precise Cypher statements. Therefore, we need to look for an alternative to guarantee consistency and robustness. What if, instead of developing Cypher statements, the LLM extracts parameters from user input and uses predefined functions or Cypher templates based on the user intent?
