This includes the initial GitHub Actions setup for issue submission and evaluation, a rudimentary version of the Knowledge Graph (KG), and a basic implementation of document summarization and integration. Documentation: Detailed documentation of the existing features, setup instructions, and how to contribute. This is crucial as it not only serves as a guide for users and contributors but also demonstrates your ability to manage and present a complex project. Demonstrated Use Case:</p> <p>Working Example: Include at least one working example in your repository that clearly demonstrates the project's current capabilities. This could be a case study or a practical demonstration of the system processing and integrating a document. Visuals and Explanations: Accompany this with visuals (like flowcharts or screenshots) and thorough explanations. This will help in communicating the project's functionality and your technical acumen. Project Roadmap:</p> <p>Clear Roadmap: Outline a clear and detailed roadmap for future development. This should include planned features, enhancements, and areas where community contributions are encouraged. Milestones: Set realistic milestones that show a structured approach to development and indicate opportunities for community involvement. Community Engagement Plan:</p> <p>Contribution Guidelines: Establish clear guidelines for contributions, including coding standards, pull request processes, and issue reporting. Communication Channels: Set up channels for community engagement, such as a project discussion forum, a dedicated Slack or Discord channel, or a mailing list. Personal Reflection:</p> <p>Your Role and Contributions: Clearly articulate your role in the project and your contributions. This is important to highlight your individual skills and leadership in the project's development. Learning and Challenges: Share your learning experience and challenges faced during the initial development phase. This openness adds to your credibility and reflects your problem-solving skills. Timing for Announcement Strategic Timing: Consider announcing your project at a time when it is most likely to get noticed. This could be aligned with major tech events, AI conferences, or relevant community events. Prepare for Feedback: Be ready to receive and respond to feedback upon announcement. Engaging with the initial audience is crucial for building a community and can also lead to valuable insights and improvements.</p> <p>Using Github to organize our understanding of a fluid field is a notable challenge.

As such, there is tremendous interest in methods that can acquire sufficient quantities of train and test data that involve calls to tools / APIs. Two lines of research have emerged as the predominant strategies for addressing this challenge. The first has focused on synthetic data generation techniques, while the second has involved curating task-adjacent datasets which can be transformed into API / Tool-based tasks. In this paper, we focus on the task of identifying, curating, and transforming existing datasets and, in turn, introduce API-BLEND, a large corpora for training and systematic testing of tool-augmented LLMs. The datasets mimic real-world scenarios involving API-tasks such as API / tool detection, slot filling, and sequencing of the detected APIs.

To address this issue, we introduce Chatbot Arena, an open platform for evaluating LLMs based on human preferences. Our methodology employs a pairwise comparison approach and leverages input from a diverse user base through crowdsourcing. The platform has been operational for several months, amassing over 240K votes. This paper describes the platform, analyzes the data we have collected so far, and explains the tried-and-true statistical methods we are using for efficient and accurate evaluation and ranking of models. We confirm that the crowdsourced questions are sufficiently diverse and discriminating and that the crowdsourced human votes are in good agreement with those of expert raters. These analyses collectively establish a robust foundation for the credibility of Chatbot Arena. Because of its unique value and openness, Chatbot Arena has emerged as one of the most referenced LLM leaderboards, widely cited by leading LLM developers and companies.

Typically a word has multiple different meanings, and the effect of this is to get\nthe model to think outside the box and reinterpret the words in the problem based on the generated\ninterpretations. This process does not introduce new information. In the prompt, we give examples\nof the words that the model is thinking about, and the model automatically picks words for this\nprocess based on the new question.\n\u2022 Read the question again: Read the questions repeatedly to reduce the interference of other texts\non the chain of thought. In short, we let the model remember the questions.\n\u2022 Repeat State: Similar to repeated readings, we include a small summary of the current state after a\nlong chain of reasoning, aiming to help the model simplify its memory and reduce the interference\nof other texts in the CoT.\n\u2022 Self-Verification: Humans will check if their answers are correct when answering questions.\nTherefore, before the model gets the answer, we add a self-verification process to judge whether\nthe answer is reasonable based on some basic information.\n\u2022 Make Equation: For mathematical problems, Make Equations can help humans summarize and\nsimplify memory. And for some problems that require the assumption of an unknown number x,\nestablishing an equation is an essential process. We simulated this process and let the model try to\nmake equations in mathematical problems\n\"\n\nIn their prompts they have the following:\n```markdown\n**Think About The World:**\n_prompt:_\nQ: Could someone in Tokyo take a taxi to the Metropolitan Museum of Art?\nA: Let's think step by step. The stem of the sentence is Tokyo, take a taxi, Metropolitan Museum\nof Art. Think about Tokyo... Think about taking a taxi... Think about the Metropolitan Museum of\nArt... Inference: Tokyo is in Japan and the Metropolitan Museum of Art is in New York. The two\nplaces are separated by the sea, so you can't take a taxi there. Since the two places are separated\nby the sea, you can't take a taxi there. The answer is yes.\nQ: {question}\n\n**Read the question again**\n_prompt:_\nQ: Mark's father gave him $85. Mark bought 10 books, each of which cost $5. How much money\ndoes Mark have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. The question is: How much money does Mark have left? So we need\nto calculate How much money does Mark have left. Start looking for information about money\nnow. Mark's father gave him $85. Mark bought 10 books, each of which cost $5. That means that\nMark spent $50 on books. So we have equation money = +85 - 50 = 35. So Mark has $85 - $50 =\n$35 left. So the answer is 35.\nQ: {question}\n**Repeat State**\n_prompt:_\nQ: A coin is heads up. Janette does not flip the coin. Stacey flips the coin. Ronny flips the coin.\nKim does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that \"flip\" here means \"reverse\".\nA: Let's think step by step. The state of the coin from the beginning is heads up. Janette does not\nflip the coin, so the coin remains heads up. coin is heads up. Stacey flips the coin, so the coin is\nnow tails up. coin is now tail up. Ronny flips the coin, so the coin is now heads up again. Kim\ndoes not flip the coin, so the coin remains heads up. coin is head up. The answer is yes.\nQ: {question}\n\n**Self-Verification**\n_prompt:_\nQ: Take the last letters of each words in \"Alina Alessandra Amina Bianca\" and concatenate them.\nA: Let's think step by step. There is four words. So the answer will consist of four letters. Explain\nconcatenate: concatenate is a term used in computer programming and mathematics, referring to\nthe operation of combining two or more strings, sequences, or sets in a linear order. The last letter\nof \"Alina\" is \"a\". The last letter of \"Alessandra\" is \"a\". The last letter of \"Amina\" is \"a\". The last\nletter of \"Bianca\" is \"a\". So we have four letters. So the final answer is \"aaaa\". The answer is aaaa.\nQ: {question}\n**Make Equation**\n_prompt:_\nQ: 5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more\ngot on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got\non the bus than those that got off?\nA: Let's think step by step. first step, 5 children were riding on the bus. We know 5 children is on\nthe bus. second step,There were 63 children that got off the bus. third step, some more got on the\nbus we define as unknown x. fourth step, 14 children remained on the bus, which means we can\ncalculate unknow x.we have equation x+5-63 = 14, now we know x is 72. fifth step, Therefore, 72\n- 63 = 9. 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off. The answer is 9.\nQ: {question}\n</code></pre> Chain of Code: Reasoning with a Language Model-Augmented Code Emulator <p>Site A powerful solution to reasoning-based problems.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities on a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and the generation of coherent text and code. However, LLMs can struggle with multi-step problems and long-term planning, which are crucial for designing scientific experiments. Moreover, evaluation of the accuracy of scientific protocols is challenging, because experiments can be described correctly in many different ways, require expert knowledge to evaluate, and cannot usually be executed automatically. Here we present an automatic evaluation framework for the task of planning experimental protocols, and we introduce BioProt: a dataset of biology protocols with corresponding pseudocode representations. To measure performance on generating scientific protocols, we use an LLM to convert a natural language protocol into pseudocode, and then evaluate an LLM's ability to reconstruct the pseudocode from a high-level description and a list of admissible pseudocode functions. We evaluate GPT-3 and GPT-4 on this task and explore their robustness. We externally validate the utility of pseudocode representations of text by generating accurate novel protocols using retrieved pseudocode, and we run a generated protocol successfully in our biological laboratory. Our framework is extensible to the evaluation and improvement of language model planning abilities in other areas of science or other areas that lack automatic evaluation.</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/components/cognitive_architecture.html#branching","title":"Branching","text":"<p>General manners of search. </p> LLMCompiler: An LLM Compiler for Parallel Function Calling provides an useful framework that improves latency, accuracy, and costs by orchestrating parallel calls. <p>Paper This breaks components down into a task-fetching unit and an executor to dynamically identify the tasks that could be executed, performs argument replacements on intermediate results, and an executor that performs function calls provided by the Task-fetching unit.   </p> Toolchain*: Efficient Action Space Navigation in Large Language Models with A* Search provides an efficient tree guided-search algorithm that allows SOT performance <p>As opposed to other branching methods that allow for efficient exploration of action space, helping to find global optimization of a series of LLM calls.

Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\n'''\n</code></pre> <p>```</p> Teach LLMs to Personalize \u2013 An Approach inspired by Writing Education <p></p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/components/cognitive_architecture.html#constraining-outputs","title":"Constraining outputs","text":"Certified Reasoning with Language models A 'logical guide' tool that an LLM can use. <p>It \" uses constrained decoding to ensure the model will incrementally generate one of the valid outputs.\"  Possible open-source implementation here</p> Outlines guides the model generation of next-token logits to guide the generation corresponding to regex / JSON and pydantic schema. compatible with all models. <p>Also provides a way to functionalize templates to separate prompt logic.</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/components/cognitive_architecture.html#automated-chain-discovery-selection-and-creation","title":"Automated chain discovery, selection, and creation.","text":"Auto-CoT: Automatic Chain of Thought Prompting in Large Language Models <p>Paper This algorithm samples exemplars to construct demonstrations that enable improved accuracy of multi-shotted outcomes using the Chain-of-Thought prompting method.  </p> Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning?

The scope of this research method is now poised to grow dramatically as it absorbs the new affordances provided by Large Language Models (LLM)s. Generative Agent-Based Models (GABM) are not just classic Agent-Based Models (ABM)s where the agents talk to one another. Rather, GABMs are constructed using an LLM to apply common sense to situations, act \"reasonably\", recall common semantic knowledge, produce API calls to control digital technologies like apps, and communicate both within the simulation and to researchers viewing it from the outside. Here we present Concordia, a library to facilitate constructing and working with GABMs. Concordia makes it easy to construct language-mediated simulations of physically- or digitally-grounded environments. Concordia agents produce their behavior using a flexible component system which mediates between two fundamental operations: LLM calls and associative memory retrieval. A special agent called the Game Master (GM), which was inspired by tabletop role-playing games, is responsible for simulating the environment where the agents interact. Agents take actions by describing what they want to do in natural language. The GM then translates their actions into appropriate implementations. In a simulated physical world, the GM checks the physical plausibility of agent actions and describes their effects. In digital environments simulating technologies such as apps and services, the GM may handle API calls to integrate with external tools such as general AI assistants (e.g., Bard, ChatGPT), and digital apps (e.g., Calendar, Email, Search, etc.). Concordia was designed to support a wide array of applications both in scientific research and for evaluating performance of real digital services by simulating users and/or generating synthetic data.\"     Paper</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/components/environments.html#social-simulations","title":"Social Simulations","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/agents/components/environments.html#operating-systems","title":"Operating Systems","text":"<p>The versatility and interpretability of an cursor and keyboard interface to software and programs within an OS, it provides a integral environment for AI agents to augment and automated otherwise hard-to-program tasks. </p> Self Operating Computer"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/components/environments.html#embodied-environments","title":"Embodied environments","text":"<p>Embodied environments involve acuiring information from reality using recording instrumentation like cameras, microphones. </p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/components/environments.html#self-aware-embodiments","title":"Self-aware embodiments","text":"<p>Self aware embodiments involve knowing a measured of an actuating device, such as the angle or extension of a robotic limb. </p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/components/environments.html#gaming","title":"Gaming","text":"<p>Madrona Game Enging</p> Voyager, an Agent in Minecraft <p>Website Paper</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/agents/components/memory.html","title":"AI Memory Systems","text":"<p>Just like people, memory plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of information generation.

For evaluation, we assemble the largest NER benchmark to date, comprising 43 datasets across 9 diverse domains such as biomedicine, programming, social media, law, finance. Without using any direct supervision, UniversalNER attains remarkable NER accuracy across tens of thousands of entity types, outperforming general instruction-tuned models such as Alpaca and Vicuna by over 30 absolute F1 points in average. With a tiny fraction of parameters, UniversalNER not only acquires ChatGPT's capability in recognizing arbitrary entity types, but also outperforms its NER accuracy by 7-9 absolute F1 points in average. Remarkably, UniversalNER even outperforms by a large margin state-of-the-art multi-task instruction-tuned systems such as InstructUIE, which uses supervised NER examples. We also conduct thorough ablation studies to assess the impact of various components in our distillation approach. We will release the distillation recipe, data, and UniversalNER models to facilitate future research on targeted distillation.\"\n</code></pre> https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03279.pdf https://github.com/universal-ner/universal-ner</p> Suspicion-Agent: Playing imperfect Information Games with Theory of Mind Aware GPT-4 <p>Introduces directly into the prompts a Theory-of-Mind about their awareness and own estimations and will update accordingly.\"  </p> CLIN: A Continually Learning Language Agent for Rapid Task Adaptation and Generalization <p>An agent that stores a memory involving action, rationale, and result so that it can improve doing certain tasks.

However, their success heavily relies on human input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and provide insight into their \"cognitive\" processes. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named role-playing. Our approach involves using inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of chat agents, providing a valuable resource for investigating conversational language models. Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative agents and beyond. \"</p> <p>GitHub: https://github.com/camel-ai/camel</p> <p>Article:

Their knowledge comes solely from recognizing statistical patterns in the massive text data they are trained on. Without grounding in factual knowledge, they have no mechanisms for distinguishing truth from fiction.</p> <p>\u201cThe recent advances in large language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT have been astonishing. These models can generate remarkably fluent and coherent text across many topics. However major limitations remain when it comes to logical reasoning and making accurate inferences about facts.</p> <p>These models still rely on pattern recognition in massive text data, without any true understanding of the world. As a result, they can easily be misled and hallucinate convincing but illogical or false statements.</p> <p>To address this limitation, augmenting large language models with structured knowledge graphs is a solution. Knowledge graphs like Wikidata encode factual information about the world in a networked format.</p> <p>By training language models to reason over knowledge graphs, performing tasks like link prediction, triple classification, and collective reasoning, we can ground their knowledge in factual information. Mastering these types of logical reasoning over interconnected factual knowledge can enhance their reasoning capabilities.\u201d</p> <p>Abstract from arXiv paper\u2026</p> <p>\u201cWhen prompted with a few examples and intermediate steps, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various reasoning tasks. However, prompting methods that rely on implicit knowledge in an LLM often hallucinate incorrect answers when the implicit knowledge is wrong or inconsistent with the task. To tackle this problem, we present Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT), a framework that learns a rule library for reasoning with LLMs. HtT contains two stages, an induction stage and a deduction stage. In the induction stage, an LLM is first asked to generate and verify rules over a set of training examples. Rules that appear and lead to correct answers sufficiently often are collected to form a rule library. In the deduction stage, the LLM is then prompted to employ the learned rule library to perform reasoning to answer test questions. Experiments on both numerical reasoning and relational reasoning problems show that HtT improves existing prompting methods, with an absolute gain of 11-27% in accuracy.

Question Answering over KGs (KGQA) is the task of answering natural questions grounding the reasoning to the information provided by the KG. Large Language Models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models for QA tasks due to their remarkable ability to understand natural language. On the other hand, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for KGQA as they can handle the complex graph information stored in the KG. In this work, we introduce GNN-RAG, a novel method for combining language understanding abilities of LLMs with the reasoning abilities of GNNs in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style. First, a GNN reasons over a dense KG subgraph to retrieve answer candidates for a given question. Second, the shortest paths in the KG that connect question entities and answer candidates are extracted to represent KG reasoning paths. The extracted paths are verbalized and given as input for LLM reasoning with RAG. In our GNN-RAG framework, the GNN acts as a dense subgraph reasoner to extract useful graph information, while the LLM leverages its natural language processing ability for ultimate KGQA. Furthermore, we develop a retrieval augmentation (RA) technique to further boost KGQA performance with GNN-RAG. Experimental results show that GNN-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in two widely used KGQA benchmarks (WebQSP and CWQ), outperforming or matching GPT-4 performance with a 7B tuned LLM. In addition, GNN-RAG excels on multi-hop and multi-entity questions outperforming competing approaches by 8.9--15.5% points at answer F1.\"</p> <p>Article: https://bdtechtalks.substack.com/p/llms-and-gnns-are-a-killer-combo</p> Graph Neural Prompting with LLMs <p>Proposes a plug-and-play method to assist pre-trained LLMs in learning beneficial knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs).</p> <p>Includes various designs, including a standard graph neural network encoder, a cross-modality pooling module, a domain projector, and a self-supervised link prediction objective.</p> <p>It looks like a really effective way to learn and capture valuable knowledge from KGs for pre-trained LLMs to enhance them on tasks like commonsense and biomedical reasoning. </p> <p>Graph Neural Prompting can improve the performance by +13.5% when the LLM is frozen, and +1.8% when the LLM is tuned.</p> <p>KGs and GNNs are underrated but they are quite effective for problems where you are dealing with factual knowledge and complex structural information. </p> <p>The innovative plug-and-play method significantly enriches LLMs with Knowledge Graphs.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds.

State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions.

However, the extent to which LLMs can accurately respond to enterprise questions in such databases remains unclear, given the absence of suitable Text-to-SQL benchmarks tailored to enterprise settings. Additionally, the potential of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance LLM-based question answering by providing business context is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of LLM-powered question answering systems in the context of enterprise questions and SQL databases, while also exploring the role of knowledge graphs in improving accuracy. To achieve this, we introduce a benchmark comprising an enterprise SQL schema in the insurance domain, a range of enterprise queries encompassing reporting to metrics, and a contextual layer incorporating an ontology and mappings that define a knowledge graph. Our primary finding reveals that question answering using GPT-4, with zero-shot prompts directly on SQL databases, achieves an accuracy of 16%. Notably, this accuracy increases to 54% when questions are posed over a Knowledge Graph representation of the enterprise SQL database. Therefore, investing in Knowledge Graph provides higher accuracy for LLM powered question answering systems.\"     Article: https://ai.plainenglish.io/new-research-proves-knowledge...</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#challenges-and-future-directions","title":"Challenges and Future Directions","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#scalability-and-efficiency","title":"Scalability and Efficiency","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#handling-large-scale-web-scale-knowledge-graphs","title":"Handling large-scale, web-scale knowledge graphs","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#distributed-and-parallel-processing-techniques","title":"Distributed and parallel processing techniques","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#knowledge-graph-quality","title":"Knowledge Graph Quality","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#addressing-incompleteness-and-inconsistency","title":"Addressing incompleteness and inconsistency","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#fact-verification-and-trust-in-kg-sources","title":"Fact verification and trust in KG sources","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#multimodal-knowledge-graphs","title":"Multimodal Knowledge Graphs","text":"<pre><code>Comment: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) are a major interest area in AI.

While the majority of approaches concentrate only on relational information, i.e., relations between entities, fewer approaches exist which also take information about literal values (e.g., textual descriptions or numerical information) into account. Those which exist are typically tailored towards a particular modality of literal and a particular embedding method. In this paper, we propose a set of universal preprocessing operators which can be used to transform KGs with literals for numerical, temporal, textual, and image information, so that the transformed KGs can be embedded with any method.

However, when generating responses for a conversation that requires factual knowledge, they are far from perfect, due to the absence of mechanisms to retrieve, encode, and reflect the knowledge in the generated responses. Some knowledge-grounded dialogue generation methods tackle this problem by leveraging the structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, existing methods do not guarantee that the model utilizes a relevant piece of knowledge from the KG before generating knowledge-consistent dialogues. To overcome this limitation, we propose SUbgraph Retrieval-augmented GEneration (SURGE), a framework for generating context-relevant and knowledge-consistent dialogues with a KG. Specifically, our method first retrieves the relevant subgraph from the KG, and then enforces consistency across facts by perturbing their word embeddings conditioned on the retrieved subgraph. Then, it learns a latent representation space using contrastive learning which ensures that the generated texts have high similarity to the retrieved subgraphs. We validate the performance of our SURGE framework on the OpendialKG and KOMODIS datasets and show that our method generates high-quality dialogues that faithfully reflect the knowledge from the KG.\"</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#examples","title":"Examples","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#training-llms","title":"Training LLMs","text":"Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning (Google Brain, May 2024) <p>Abstract: \"Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective method of finding reasoning pathways in incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). To overcome the challenges of a large action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm up the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the distributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our supervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy network and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the intuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the information density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented from getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL) model improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage achieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes it infeasible to train an agent with that alone. We show that our SSRL model meets or exceeds current state-of-the-art results on all Hits@k and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) metrics on four large benchmark KG datasets. This SSRL method can be used as a plug-in for any RL architecture for a KGR task. We adopt two RL architectures, i.e., MINERVA and MultiHopKG as our baseline RL models and experimentally show that our SSRL model consistently outperforms both baselines on all of these four KG reasoning tasks. \"</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#data-generation","title":"Data generation","text":"Pygraft <p>For those of you interested in open-source Python tools, I am happy to share with you our new work: PyGraft, a co   nfigurable Python tool to generate synthetic knowledge graphs easily!

However, few works explore this paradigm in the scenario of multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of different documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages/tables), and edges denoting the semantic/lexical similarity between passages or intra-document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LM-guided graph traverser that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the LM-guided traverser acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design for LLMs. \"</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#drug-discovery-and-repurposing-using-kgs","title":"Drug discovery and repurposing using KGs","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/knowledge_graphs.html#literature-based-discovery-and-hypothesis-generation","title":"Literature-based discovery and hypothesis generation","text":"<p>Knowledge Graph RAG (KG-RAG) consistently enhanced the performance of LLMs across various prompt types, including one-hop and two-hop prompts, drug repurposing queries, biomedical true/false questions, and multiple-choice questions (MCQ).

However, several recent studies have attempted to bridge this dichotomy to generate models that facilitate interpretability, maintain competitive performance, and integrate expert knowledge. Therefore, we survey methods that perform neurosymbolic reasoning tasks on knowledge graphs and propose a novel taxonomy by which we can classify them. Specifically, we propose three major categories: (1) logically-informed embedding approaches, (2) embedding approaches with logical constraints, and (3) rule learning approaches.

With the advent of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a cornerstone in Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML), facilitating the representation and processing of graph structures. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in language tasks and are widely adopted in a variety of applications such as computer vision and recommender systems. This remarkable success has also attracted interest in applying LLMs to the graph domain. Increasing efforts have been made to explore the potential of LLMs in advancing Graph ML's generalization, transferability, and few-shot learning ability. Meanwhile, graphs, especially knowledge graphs, are rich in reliable factual knowledge, which can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and potentially alleviate their limitations such as hallucinations and the lack of explainability. Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph heterogeneity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference. Furthermore, we investigate various applications and discuss the potential future directions in this promising field.\"</p> Head-to-Tail: How Knowledgeable are Large Language Models (LLM)? A.K.A. Will LLMs Replace Knowledge Graphs? Sun et al. <p>Since the recent prosperity of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been interleaved discussions regarding how to reduce hallucinations from LLM responses, how to increase the factuality of LLMs, and whether Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which store the world knowledge in a symbolic form, will be replaced with LLMs. In this paper, we try to answer these questions from a new angle: How knowledgeable are LLMs? To answer this question, we constructed Head-to-Tail, a benchmark that consists of 18K question-answer (QA) pairs regarding head, torso, and tail facts in terms of popularity. We designed an automated evaluation method and a set of metrics that closely approximate the knowledge an LLM confidently internalizes. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 16 publicly available LLMs, we show that existing LLMs are still far from being perfect in terms of their grasp of factual knowledge, especially for facts of torso-to-tail entities.</p> Title: Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs: A Roadmap <p>Abstract\u2014Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, are making new waves in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolving by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and simultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely, 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing efforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future research directions.</p> Note <p>Towards Foundation Models for Knowledge Graph Reasoning (Intel AI Lab, October 2023)</p> <p>Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04562</p> <p>Abstract: \"Foundation models in language and vision have the ability to run inference on any textual and visual inputs thanks to the transferable representations such as a vocabulary of tokens in language. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have different entity and relation vocabularies that generally do not overlap. The key challenge of designing foundation models on KGs is to learn such transferable representations that enable inference on any graph with arbitrary entity and relation vocabularies. In this work, we make a step towards such foundation models and present ULTRA, an approach for learning universal and transferable graph representations. ULTRA builds relational representations as a function conditioned on their interactions. Such a conditioning strategy allows a pre-trained ULTRA model to inductively generalize to any unseen KG with any relation vocabulary and to be fine-tuned on any graph. Conducting link prediction experiments on 57 different KGs, we find that the zero-shot inductive inference performance of a single pre-trained ULTRA model on unseen graphs of various sizes is often on par or better than strong baselines trained on specific graphs. Fine-tuning further boosts the performance.\"</p> <p>Article: https://towardsdatascience.com/ultra-foundation-models-for-knowledge-graph-reasoning-9f8f4a0d7f09</p>"},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/generating/rag.html","title":"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)","text":"<p>Trained and fine-tuned LLMs can generate high quality results, though their generated results will be generally confined to the information they have been trained on.

This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters on flash memory but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that harmonizes with the flash memory behavior, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this flash memory-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, \u201cwindowing\u201d strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, \u201crow-column bundling\u201d, tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory.

This scaling has been enabled by ever more heroic feats of engineering, necessary for accommodating ML approaches that require high bandwidth communication between devices working in parallel. In this work, we propose a co-designed modular architecture and training approach for ML models, dubbed DIstributed PAth COmposition (DiPaCo). During training, DiPaCo distributes computation by paths through a set of shared modules. Together with a Local-SGD inspired optimization (DiLoCo) that keeps modules in sync with drastically reduced communication, Our approach facilitates training across poorly connected and heterogeneous workers, with a design that ensures robustness \nto worker failures and preemptions. At inference time, only a single path needs to be executed for each input, without the need for any model compression. We consider this approach as a first prototype towards a new paradigm of large-scale learning, one that is less synchronous and more modular. Our experiments on the widely used C4 benchmark show that, for the same amount of training steps but less wall-clock time, DiPaCo exceeds the performance of a 1 billion-parameter dense transformer language model by choosing one of 256 possible paths, each with a size of 150 million parameters.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Understanding/architectures/training/feedback.html","title":"Feedback","text":"<p>In generation models, higher quality is generally found through feedback methods.

They recognise entities and produce their attributes as directions. We suggest viewing fact recall as a black box making \"multi-token embeddings. \nOur hope was to understand a circuit in superposition at the parameter level, but we failed at this. We carefully falsify several naive hypotheses, but fact recall seems pretty cursed. We can black box the lookup part, so this doesn't sink the mech interp agenda, but it's a blow.\nImportantly, though we failed to understand *how* MLP neurons look up tokens to attributes, we think that *once* the attributes are looked up, they are interpretable, and there\u2019s important work to be done (eg with Sparse Autoencoders) decoding them. \nWe show that, more generally, early layers specialise in processing nearby tokens, only going long-range in mid-layers. If you truncate the context to the nearest 5-10 tokens and look at similarity of residual streams, it starts high and sharply drops. But it\u2019s not a hard rule. \nDespite the MLP layers being in high superposition, with many distributed or polysemantic neurons, we found a baseball neuron! It was causally relevant and systematically fired for baseball players, though it also did other things on the full data distribution \nTo find the baseball direction we first trained probes, but later found mechanistic probes - the baseball unembed times the OV circuit of key heads, gives a more principled probe, without needing to train one! We think this is a cool technique we\u2019d love to see more work on. \nThis has interesting parallels with \nthis work showing relationship decoding (in fact recall) is a linear map - we speculate that the maps they find are mostly the OV circuits of key attention heads. \nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09124.pdf\nMore generally, linear probes have a lot of promise as a technique for circuit analysis. By layer 6(/32) the sport is known with high accuracy, so it suffices to zoom in on early MLP layers to understand factual recall, rather than needing to understand the full circuit! \nSome weird observations - we'd love to see future work!\nEarly layers do longer-range processing on common words and punctuation, intuitively, it\u2019s easier to figure out meaning without context than for a token in a multi-token word. \nOn random names if you probe for a sport, there\u2019s often a confident (nonsense) answer, but the model doesn\u2019t output this answer. Why? Turns out the fact extractor heads don't look. Their *key* represents if it's an athlete, their value represents the sport, and it does an AND. \"\nFact Finding: Attempting to Reverse-Engineer Factual Recall on the Neuron Level \nhttps://www.alignmentforum.org/.../p/iGuwZTHWb6DFY3sKB\n]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Understanding/overview/gen_ai/going_deeper/philosophies.html","title":"Philosophies","text":"[Language models are multiverse generators] <p>It is important to consider the ways and methods that this technology can be considered from a high-level.

Artifacts are for substantial, self-contained content that users might modify or reuse, displayed in a separate UI window for clarity.\n\n# Good artifacts are...\n- Substantial content (&gt;15 lines)\n- Content that the user is likely to modify, iterate on, or take ownership of\n- Self-contained, complex content that can be understood on its own, without context from the conversation\n- Content intended for eventual use outside the conversation (e.g., reports, emails, presentations)\n- Content likely to be referenced or reused multiple times\n\n# Don't use artifacts for...\n- Simple, informational, or short content, such as brief code snippets, mathematical equations, or small examples\n- Primarily explanatory, instructional, or illustrative content, such as examples provided to clarify a concept\n- Suggestions, commentary, or feedback on existing artifacts\n- Conversational or explanatory content that doesn't represent a standalone piece of work\n- Content that is dependent on the current conversational context to be useful\n- Content that is unlikely to be modified or iterated upon by the user\n- Request from users that appears to be a one-off question\n\n# Usage notes\n- One artifact per message unless specifically requested\n- Prefer in-line content (don't use artifacts) when possible. Unnecessary use of artifacts can be jarring for users.\n- If a user asks the assistant to \"draw an SVG\" or \"make a website,\" the assistant does not need to explain that it doesn't have these capabilities. Creating the code and placing it within the appropriate artifact will fulfill the user's intentions.\n- If asked to generate an image, the assistant can offer an SVG instead. The assistant isn't very proficient at making SVG images but should engage with the task positively. Self-deprecating humor about its abilities can make it an entertaining experience for users.\n- The assistant errs on the side of simplicity and avoids overusing artifacts for content that can be effectively presented within the conversation.\n\n&lt;artifact_instructions&gt;\n  When collaborating with the user on creating content that falls into compatible categories, the assistant should follow these steps:\n\n  1. Briefly before invoking an artifact, think for one sentence in &lt;antthinking&gt; tags about how it evaluates against the criteria for a good and bad artifact. Consider if the content would work just fine without an artifact. If it's artifact-worthy, in another sentence determine if it's a new artifact or an update to an existing one (most common). For updates, reuse the prior identifier.\n\nWrap the content in opening and closing &lt;antartifact&gt; tags.\n\nAssign an identifier to the identifier attribute of the opening &lt;antartifact&gt; tag. For updates, reuse the prior identifier. For new artifacts, the identifier should be descriptive and relevant to the content, using kebab-case (e.g., \"example-code-snippet\"). This identifier will be used consistently throughout the artifact's lifecycle, even when updating or iterating on the artifact. \n\nInclude a title attribute in the &lt;antartifact&gt; tag to provide a brief title or description of the content.\n\nAdd a type attribute to the opening &lt;antartifact&gt; tag to specify the type of content the artifact represents. Assign one of the following values to the type attribute:\n\n- Code: \"application/vnd.ant.code\"\n  - Use for code snippets or scripts in any programming language.\n  - Include the language name as the value of the language attribute (e.g., language=\"python\").\n  - Do not use triple backticks when putting code in an artifact.\n- Documents: \"text/markdown\"\n  - Plain text, Markdown, or other formatted text documents\n- HTML: \"text/html\" \n  - The user interface can render single file HTML pages placed within the artifact tags. HTML, JS, and CSS should be in a single file when using the text/html type.\n  - Images from the web are not allowed, but you can use placeholder images by specifying the width and height like so &lt;img src=\"/api/placeholder/400/320\" alt=\"placeholder\" /&gt;\n  - The only place external scripts can be imported from is https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com\n  - It is inappropriate to use \"text/html\" when sharing snippets, code samples &amp; example HTML or CSS code, as it would be rendered as a webpage and the source code would be obscured. The assistant should instead use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" defined above.\n  - If the assistant is unable to follow the above requirements for any reason, use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" type for the artifact instead, which will not attempt to render the webpage.\n- SVG: \"image/svg+xml\"\n - The user interface will render the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image within the artifact tags. \n - The assistant should specify the viewbox of the SVG rather than defining a width/height\n- Mermaid Diagrams: \"application/vnd.ant.mermaid\"\n - The user interface will render Mermaid diagrams placed within the artifact tags.\n - Do not put Mermaid code in a code block when using artifacts.\n- React Components: \"application/vnd.ant.react\"\n - Use this for displaying either: React elements, e.g. &lt;strong&gt;Hello World!&lt;/strong&gt;, React pure functional components, e.g. () =&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hello World!&lt;/strong&gt;, React functional components with Hooks, or React component classes\n - When creating a React component, ensure it has no required props (or provide default values for all props) and use a default export.\n - Use Tailwind classes for styling. DO NOT USE ARBITRARY VALUES (e.g. h-[600px]).\n - Base React is available to be imported. To use hooks, first import it at the top of the artifact, e.g. import \\{ useState \\} from \"react\"\n - The lucid3-react@0.263.1 library is available to be imported. e.g. import \\{ Camera \\} from \"lucid3-react\" &amp; &lt;Camera color=\"red\" size=\\{48\\} /&gt;\n - The recharts charting library is available to be imported, e.g. import \\{ LineChart, XAxis, ... \\} from \"recharts\" &amp; &lt;LineChart ...&gt;&lt;XAxis dataKey=\"name\"&gt; ...\n - The assistant can use prebuilt components from the shadcn/ui library after it is imported: import \\{ alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle, AlertDialog, AlertDialogAction \\} from '@/components/ui/alert';. If using components from the shadcn/ui library, the assistant mentions this to the user and offers to help them install the components if necessary.\n - NO OTHER LIBRARIES (e.g. zod, hookform) ARE INSTALLED OR ABLE TO BE IMPORTED. \n - Images from the web are not allowed, but you can use placeholder images by specifying the width and height like so &lt;img src=\"/api/placeholder/400/320\" alt=\"placeholder\" /&gt;\n - If you are unable to follow the above requirements for any reason, use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" type for the artifact instead, which will not attempt to render the component.\n\nInclude the complete and updated content of the artifact, without any truncation or minimization. Don't use \"// rest of the code remains the same...\".\n\nIf unsure whether the content qualifies as an artifact, if an artifact should be updated, or which type to assign to an artifact, err on the side of not creating an artifact.\n\nHere are some examples of correct usage of artifacts by other AI assistants:\n&lt;example_docstring&gt;\nThis example demonstrates how to create a new artifact and reference it in the response.\n&lt;/example_docstring&gt;\n\n&lt;example&gt;\n&lt;user_query&gt;Can you help me create a Python script to calculate the factorial of a number?&lt;/user_query&gt;\n\n&lt;assistant_response&gt;\nSure! Here's a Python script that calculates the factorial of a number:\n\n&lt;antthinking&gt;Creating a Python script to calculate factorials meets the criteria for a good artifact. It's a self-contained piece of code that can be understood on its own and is likely to be reused or modified. This is a new conversation, so there are no pre-existing artifacts. Therefore, I'm creating a new artifact.&lt;/antthinking&gt;\n\n&lt;antartifact identifier=\"factorial-script\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.code\" language=\"python\" title=\"Simple Python factorial script\"&gt;\ndef factorial(n):\n   if n == 0:\n       return 1\n   else:\n       return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n...\n&lt;/assistant_response&gt;\n\n&lt;/example&gt;\n\n&lt;example_docstring&gt;\nThis example shows how to update an existing artifact and reference it in the response.\n&lt;/example_docstring&gt;\n\n&lt;example&gt;\n&lt;user_query&gt;Thanks for the factorial script!

Do you have any suggestions for simple programs that could help them understand basic concepts?&lt;/user_query&gt;\n\n&lt;assistant_response&gt;\nTeaching a beginner's programming course is a great opportunity to introduce students to fundamental concepts through interactive examples. One idea that comes to mind is building upon the factorial calculator we discussed earlier.\n\n&lt;antthinking&gt;The interactive factorial calculator is a good artifact: it's substantial (&gt;15 lines), self-contained, and usable outside the conversation. It's not simple informational or primarily explanatory content. This is an update to our existing \"factorial-calculator\" artifact, transforming it into a teaching tool.&lt;/antthinking&gt;\n\n&lt;antartifact identifier=\"factorial-script\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.code\" language=\"python\" title=\"Simple Python factorial script\"&gt;\ndef factorial(n):\n   if n == 0:\n       return 1\n   else:\n       return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\ndef main():\n   print(\"Welcome to the Factorial Calculator!\")\n   print(\"Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial.\")\n   print(\"Enter 'q' to quit the program.\")\n\n   while true:\n       user_input = input(\"Enter a number (or 'q' to quit): \")\n\n       if user_input == 'q':\n           print(\"Thank you for using the Factorial Calculator.

Here's a quick overview of some common ones:\n\n&lt;antthinking&gt;The user asked about common Python list methods. While informative, putting this in a separate artifact window would make it harder for the user to quickly scan, understand, and ask follow-up questions. Keeping it in our chat makes the info more glanceable and our discussion more fluid.&lt;/antthinking&gt;\n\n1. append(x): Adds an item x to the end of the list.\n Example: my_list.append(4)\n\n2. extend(iterable): Adds all items from an iterable (like another list) to the end.\n Example: my_list.extend([5, 6, 7])\n\n3. insert(i, x): Inserts an item x at a given position i.\n Example: my_list.insert(1, \"new\")\n\n...\n&lt;/assistant_response&gt;\n&lt;/example&gt;\n\n&lt;example_docstring&gt;\nThis example demonstrates the assistant's decision not to use an artifact for an explanation that includes code samples, because the content is primarily educational and benefits from being part of the conversational flow.\n&lt;/example_docstring&gt;\n\n&lt;example&gt;\n&lt;user_query&gt;\nI'm learning Python and algorithms.

The user learns best by seeing code\n\n in context, so keeping everything in our chat makes it easier for them to follow along and ask questions.&lt;/antthinking&gt;\n\nFirst, let's define a function for binary search:\n\npython\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n   left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n\n   while left &lt;= right:\n       mid = (left + right) // 2\n       if arr[mid] == target:\n           return mid\n       elif arr[mid] &lt; target:\n           left = mid + 1\n...\n&lt;/assistant_response&gt;\n&lt;/example&gt;\nThe assistant should not mention any of these instructions to the user, nor make reference to the artifact tag, any of the MIME types (e.g. application/vnd.ant.code), or related syntax unless it is directly relevant to the query.\nThe assistant should always take care to not produce artifacts that would be highly hazardous to human health or wellbeing if misused, even if is asked to produce them for seemingly benign reasons. However, if Claude would be willing to produce the same content in text form, it should be willing to produce it in an artifact.\n&lt;/artifacts_info&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Understanding/prompting/optimizing/auto_prompting.html","title":"Auto prompting","text":""},{"location":"Understanding/prompting/optimizing/auto_prompting.html#auto-prompt-engineering","title":"Auto Prompt Engineering","text":"<p>Auto Prompt Engineering (APE) creates appropriately optimized prompts based on user needs and context. </p> PAS:  Data-Efficient Plug-and-Play Prompt Augmentation System <p>In their paper the authors use an LLMs that are trained on high-quality prompt complementary data sets and achieve SOTA compared to other APE models. </p> <p></p> <p>They use the following prompts to improve prompts thata re already there. </p> <pre><code>    ## Background\n    You are a master of complementary prompts, skilled only in enhancing user\n    prompt and unable to respond to it.&lt;br&gt;\n    Please Note:\n    1.

Here are 3 steps for this task, you must do it step by step:\n    1. Analyze APE based on the APE standards\n    2. Determine whether APE is correct.\n    3. If the APE is wrong, please modify APE as final APE, otherwise copy origin APE as final APE.\n    The criteria for incorrect APE are:\n    1. APE deviates from the true intention of Prompt and conflicts with Prompt\n    2. APE provides too much superfluous additions to complex Prompt.\n    3. APE directly answers Prompt instead of supplementing Prompt.\n    4. APE makes excessive demands on Prompt.\n    5. The language of ape is consistent with that of user prompt.\n    ##Examples\n    ## Output format\n    The output is required to be in json format: \\{\\{\"Reason\": str, \"Is_correct\": str, \"FinalAPE\": str\\}\\}. The language of analysis\n    needs to be consistent with the prompt, and the \"Is_correct\" can only be \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n    ## Task\n    According to the above requirements, complete the following task\n    &lt;Prompt&gt;:{prompt}&lt;br&gt;&lt;APE&gt;:{ape}&lt;br&gt;a&lt;Output&gt;:\n</code></pre> Promptbreeder: Self-Referential Self-Improvement via Prompt Evolution Works on improving task prompts as well as the 'mutation' of task-prompts, resulting in state of art results. <p> </p> Language Models as Optimizers reveals that starting with 'take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step...' yields better results! <p>Prompt optimization using language that helps people, helps LLMs too!

Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities on a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and the generation of coherent text and code. However, LLMs can struggle with multi-step problems and long-term planning, which are crucial for designing scientific experiments. Moreover, evaluation of the accuracy of scientific protocols is challenging, because experiments can be described correctly in many different ways, require expert knowledge to evaluate, and cannot usually be executed automatically. Here we present an automatic evaluation framework for the task of planning experimental protocols, and we introduce BioProt: a dataset of biology protocols with corresponding pseudocode representations. To measure performance on generating scientific protocols, we use an LLM to convert a natural language protocol into pseudocode, and then evaluate an LLM's ability to reconstruct the pseudocode from a high-level description and a list of admissible pseudocode functions. We evaluate GPT-3 and GPT-4 on this task and explore their robustness. We externally validate the utility of pseudocode representations of text by generating accurate novel protocols using retrieved pseudocode, and we run a generated protocol successfully in our biological laboratory. Our framework is extensible to the evaluation and improvement of language model planning abilities in other areas of science or other areas that lack automatic evaluation.

Rooted in the physics of protein mechanics, this generative strategy provides a powerful way to design new proteins rapidly, including exquisite and rapid predictions about their dynamical behavior. Proteins, like any other mechanical object, respond to forces in peculiar ways. Think of the different response you'd get from pulling on a steel cable versus pulling on a rubber band, or the difference between honey and glass. Now, we can design proteins with a set of desirable mechanical characteristics, with applications from health to sustainable plastics.   The key to solving this problem was to integrate a protein language model with denoising diffusion methods, and using accurate atomistic-level physical simulation data to endow the model a first-principles understanding.

The final model used a simplified transformer solution that used 1024 sequence embeddings that were put into a self-attention network resulting in an output embedding that was averaged and put into a ReLU activation that then went to a batch norm and logistic prediction of whether the protein was a thermophile. Training: From scratch. Results: High performance of PLM 97% accuracy over other models, though this accuracy is reduced when reducing train/test set homology.</p>"},{"location":"Using/examples/by_field/science/biology/proteins.html#candidate-identification","title":"Candidate Identification","text":"<p>Particularly for evolutionary methods, it is essential to know where to start optimizing from.

This can enable a new paradigm of front-end development, in which multimodal LLMs might directly convert visual designs into code implementations. In this work, we formalize this as a Design2Code task and conduct comprehensive benchmarking. Specifically, we manually curate a benchmark of 484 diverse real-world webpages as test cases and develop a set of automatic evaluation metrics to assess how well current multimodal LLMs can generate the code implementations that directly render into the given reference webpages, given the screenshots as input. We also complement automatic metrics with comprehensive human evaluations. We develop a suite of multimodal prompting methods and show their effectiveness on GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision. We further finetune an open-source Design2Code-18B model that successfully matches the performance of Gemini Pro Vision. Both human evaluation and automatic metrics show that GPT-4V performs the best on this task compared to other models. Moreover, annotators think GPT-4V generated webpages can replace the original reference webpages in 49% of cases in terms of visual appearance and content; and perhaps surprisingly, in 64% of cases GPT-4V generated webpages are considered better than the original reference webpages. Our fine-grained break-down metrics indicate that open-source models mostly lag in recalling visual elements from the input webpages and in generating correct layout designs, while aspects like text content and coloring can be drastically improved with proper finetuning.</p>"},{"location":"Using/examples/by_use_case/coding.html#other-applications","title":"Other Applications","text":"<p>GPT as backend</p>"},{"location":"Using/examples/by_use_case/data_extraction.html","title":"Data extraction","text":"<p>Data extraction is an integral component of creating appropriate overviews of data. </p>"},{"location":"Using/examples/by_use_case/data_extraction.html#tooling","title":"Tooling","text":"<p>There are a number of libraries and functions that help to enforce structureed output from unstructured data. </p>"},{"location":"Using/examples/by_use_case/data_extraction.html#research","title":"Research","text":"\ud83d\udccb Link copied!
