## Chains

Chains can be considered linked generative interactions where information can be processed with interepreters, tools, or other agents/GenAIs.

Done well, they can be built up to form reasoning systems that can enable more successful reasoning, or task completion.

- [Graph of Thought](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tonyseale_gpt4-promptengineering-semanticweb-activity-7075381524631580672-TAv3/) An excellent thought on what next to consider when dealing with knowledge (or other output like information) generation chains.

- [Certified Reasoning with Language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04031) A 'logical guide' tool that an LLM can use. It " uses _constrained decoding_ to ensure the model will incrementally generate one of the valid outputs."
