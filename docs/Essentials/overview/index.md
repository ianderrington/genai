## Basic engineering. 


## Available models

There are both open and closed-source models, that can be used. Because of computation requirements, more-powerful hardware may be needed to run these models, so they are often run with cloud-based services. We share an incomplete list [here](../applied_engineering/models.md)

### Model Overviews

Below we provide references to concepts that extend beyond transformer-based models.
