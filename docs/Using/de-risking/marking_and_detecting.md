It is increasingly apparent that the gap between content created by people and by AI is closing. In fact [Open AI](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/openai-admits-that-ai-writing-detectors-dont-work/) confirms this. There are challenges with false-positive detections where person-created content, like the [Constitution of the United States](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/why-ai-detectors-think-the-us-constitution-was-written-by-ai/) have been inappropriately attributed to AI.

This is likely going to be worse as AI can be used to mimic the style of individuals, through fine-tuning, multi-shot prompting, etc.

That said, there are a few detectors that might be useful in understanding content's origin -- they just need to be used with a degree of uncertainty.

Here are a few:
