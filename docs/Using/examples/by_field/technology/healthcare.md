### LLM-based Agentic Systems in Healthcare

LLM-based agentic systems are transforming healthcare by combining the language capabilities of LLMs with the ability to process information, plan, decide, recall, reflect, interact, and leverage various tools. These systems represent a new paradigm in healthcare automation and decision support.

#### Key Capabilities
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Multi-modal data processing (text, images, signals)
- Tool and API integration
- Memory and context management
- Collaborative decision-making
- Continuous learning and adaptation

#### Clinical Workflow Automation
- Automated clinical note drafting from doctor-patient conversations
- Automated investigation order placement for clinician review
- Compliance with standard operating procedures and guidelines
- Estimated to automate up to 47% of labor tasks when equipped with tool use
- Integration with real-time clinical workflows for note-writing and electronic ordering
- Prediction capabilities for readmission rates and other clinical outcomes

#### Trustworthy Medical AI
- Retrieval-augmented generation to reduce hallucinations
- Integration with authorized hospital databases and clinical guidelines
- Autonomous verify-rectify-verify processes for output validation
- Enhanced reliability in clinical calculations
- Framework for model auditing using expert insights and counterfactual images
- Understanding AI reasoning processes in medical image classification

#### Ethical Considerations and Governance
!!! note "[Generative Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Ethical Considerations and Assessment Checklist](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02107.pdf)"
    Provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating GenAI in healthcare applications:
    - [TREGAI Github](https://github.com/nliulab/GenAI-Ethical-Checklist)
    - [DocX checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ro_-GqITKHfNpHYTegUQdE-xm5t0Rvm6/view)
    
    Key considerations:
    - Patient privacy and data security
    - Model transparency and interpretability
    - Fairness and bias mitigation
    - Clinical validation and safety
    - Regulatory compliance

### Clinical Applications

#### Multi-Agent-Aided Diagnosis
- Collaboration between specialist agents for complex cases
- Mirrors multidisciplinary approaches in clinical practice
- Particularly valuable for rare conditions or resource-limited settings
- Automated identification of relevant specialist agents for case discussion

#### Medical Imaging and Diagnostics
!!! note "[Understanding the reasoning process of complex medical decisions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01160-9)"
    Uses counterfactual images and expert clinicians to understand AI reasoning in medical image classification, going beyond traditional saliency maps. The framework reveals that classifiers rely on both human-like features (lesional pigmentation patterns) and potentially undesirable features (background skin texture).
