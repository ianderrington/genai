### Code Generation

Very powerfully it can generate code to accomplish a task based on natural language input. This is very promising but still requires human oversight, due to the [challenge](../../../../Understanding/overview/challenges.md) associated with using Automated AI systems without human input or oversight.

    "In this work, we use a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. We start with a seed "improver" that improves an input program according to a given utility function by querying a language model several times and returning the best solution. We then run this seed improver to improve itself. "
