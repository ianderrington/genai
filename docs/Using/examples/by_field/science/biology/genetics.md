??? abstract "[Genomic language model predicts protein co-regulation and function](https://github.com/y-hwang/gLM)"

    The authors show in their [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46947-9#Sec30) the ability to train genomic language models on top of protein language modesl (ESM2)  "on millions of metagenomic scaffolds to learn the laten functional and regulatory relationships between genes." Their reveal "a promising approach to encode functional semantics and regulatory syntax of genes in ther genomic context and uncover complex relationships between genes in a genomic region."

    **Developments** The authors show in their [paper](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2024/09/24/gr.279142.124.abstract) a model capable of generating Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) like protors and enhancers that can regulate the epxression of Genes. These are useful for biomanufacturing as well as other therapeutic applications.
