??? tip "[Grammar-Induced Geometry for Data-Efficient Molecular Property Prediction](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SGQi3LgFnqj) IMPORTANT uses heirarchichal metagraphs to stitch-together molecular nodes. "
    This results in leaves that are 'actual' molecules. Using graph neural-diffusion, it does amazingly well even with minimal data-sets (100 examples).

    **Developments** The authors introduce a reaction representation, GraphRXNX that predicts reactions with graph-neuralnetworks. The model predicted graphical dataset reactions beyond baseline models.

??? tip "[Optimizing Chemical Reactions with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2017)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/epdf/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00492)" deep-reaction-optimizer
    The authors reveal the use of models that iteratively improve outcomes for [lab in loop optimization](./index.md#lab-in-loop-optimization) using deep learning models. Using RNN-enabled re-inforcement learning. The resulting Deep Reaction Optimizer (DRO) is supposed to "guide interactive decision-making procedure in optimizing reactions" by combining deep RL with chemistry domain knowledge.
