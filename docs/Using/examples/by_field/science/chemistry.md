??? tip "[Grammar-Induced Geometry for Data-Efficient Molecular Property Prediction](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SGQi3LgFnqj) IMPORTANT uses heirarchichal metagraphs to stitch-together molecular nodes. "
    This results in leaves that are 'actual' molecules. Using graph neural-diffusion, it does amazingly well even with minimal data-sets (100 examples).
