Generative AI has one of the most powerful potentials for science by enabling rapid-iteration closed-loop science-loop systems. A science loop system is one where measurements inform understanding in such a way to make better experiments and solutions.

### Autonomous Science in the Loop

Science in the Loop Optimizaton enables for the creation and optimization of scientific-related components. Generally related to manual or semiautonomous autonomous biological, biochemistry, or chemistry laboratories, they may extend to other domains.
