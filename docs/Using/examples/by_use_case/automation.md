# Workflow Automation

## AI Agents vs Workflow Automation

Before diving into specific tools and approaches, it's important to understand the key differences between AI Agents and Workflow Automation systems. While both aim to automate tasks, they operate in fundamentally different ways:

| Aspect | AI Agents and Teams | Workflow Automation |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Purpose | Dynamic decision-making, enhance team capabilities | Automate repetitive, generally rule-based, tasks |
| Core Functionality | Language understanding, contextual assistance | Trigger-based actions, workflow automation |
| Ease of Use | Requires setup and training | User-friendly, often no coding needed |
| Integration and Customization | Code-based integration with custom and commercial apps | Manual-integration with multiple apps/services |
| Pricing | LLM API and observability costs | LLM API costs and scale based subscriptions |
| Testing and Optimization | Enabled programmatically | Generally manual |
| Tasks | Complex, open-ended goals and tasks | Simpler and predefined tasks and procedures |
| Scalability | Scalability determined by code efficiency and hosting providers | Scalable through tiered service models |
| Options | [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/), [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/), Microsoft Copilot | Make, n8n, Zapier, Stack, Voiceflow |

Both small and bigger workflows can be automated based on algorithmic triggers or user requests. There are two primary methods for creating workflow automations:

| Type | How Automations are made | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------------------|------|------|
| Manual Workflow Automation | Designed and built by users using visual interfaces that represent steps as nodes, edges, and triggers. Templates and chat assisted can help creation but still require the user to configure steps. | Cross-service integrations, multi-step business processes, data transformation, enterprise process orchestration. | Can be highly laborious to create, manage and fix |
| Automatic Workflow Automation | 1. The system records user interaction (clicks, form fills) and uses AI pattern recognition to build workflows. The system learns from user actions<br>or<br>2. The user describes what needs to be done, a plan is made and it is executed. | Desktop task automation, repetitive user interface tasks, process mining, and tasks where capturing live user behavior reduces design overhead. | Potential security concerns<br><br>Greater potential for mistakes |

    ü§ñRobotic Process Automation (RPA) is the *de facto* enterprise automation solution today. In RPA, a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of fixed rules to complete a workflow. RPA has been great for narrow use cases, with reported ROIs of 30-200% and 2x'ing the speed of workflows. 

    üòïHowever, this rule-based approach means RPA struggles in more complex settings like healthcare due to high set-up costs üí∞and unreliable execution ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

    Multimodal foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4 could overcome these limitations via their generalized reasoning ü§îand planning skills üìã, and recent research shows promise in applying them to simple web navigation tasks

    But can we turn these proof-of-concepts into enterprise-ready solutions? 

    We take a first step by proposing ECLAIR, a system for applying multimodal FMs to all 3 stages of traditional RPA:  üëÄ demonstrate, ‚ö°Ô∏èexecute, and üîçvalidate.

    üè• We apply it to a real-world healthcare workflow.

    üëÄ Demonstrate: ECLAIR records a nurse placing an order for a telesitter in Epic (an electronic health record system), then synthesizes the recording into a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that captures the nurse's domain expertise for executing the workflow. 

    ECLAIR operates Epic just like a human (e.g. clicks and keystrokes), with zero IT integration or APIs required. 

    üîç Validate: ECLAIR stops once it determines the workflow is finished, then rewatches a recording of its own execution to confirm that it successfully completed the task. 

    While we're very excited by its potential, ECLAIR is just a first step in applying FMs to enterprise workflows. There are tons of opportunities for future work, from improving error handling and self-monitoring to human-in-the-loop collaboration and better action grounding.

    abs: Automating enterprise workflows could unlock $4 trillion/year in productivity gains. Despite being of interest to the data management community for decades, the ultimate vision of end-to-end workflow automation has remained elusive. Current solutions rely on process mining and robotic process automation (RPA), in which a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of predefined rules for completing a workflow. Through case studies of a hospital and large B2B enterprise, we find that the adoption of RPA has been inhibited by high set-up costs (12-18 months), unreliable execution (60% initial accuracy), and burdensome maintenance (requiring multiple FTEs). Multimodal foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 offer a promising new approach for end-to-end workflow automation given their generalized reasoning and planning abilities. To study these capabilities we propose ECLAIR, a system to automate enterprise workflows with minimal human supervision. We conduct initial experiments showing that multimodal FMs can address the limitations of traditional RPA with (1) near-human-level understanding of workflows (93% accuracy on a workflow understanding task) and (2) instant set-up with minimal technical barrier (based solely on a natural language description of a workflow, ECLAIR achieves end-to-end completion rates of 40%). We identify human-AI collaboration, validation, and self-improvement as open challenges, and suggest ways they can be solved with data management techniques. Code is available at: this https URL
