    "This Article begins to lay those new legal foundations. It is the first to think systematically about the dynamics of strategic competition between humans and misaligned AGI. The Article begins by showing, using formal game-theoretic models, that, by default, humans and AIs will be trapped in a prisoner's dilemma. Both parties' dominant strategy will be to permanently disempower or destroy the other, even though the costs of such conflict would be high. 
    The Article then argues that a surprising legal intervention could transform the game theoretic equilibrium and avoid conflict: AI rights. Not just any AI rights would promote human safety. Granting AIs the right not to be needlessly harmed-as humans have granted to certain non-human animals-would, for example, have little effect. Instead, to promote human safety, AIs should be given those basic private law rightsto make contracts, hold property, and bring tort claims-that law already extends to non-human corporations. Granting AIs these economic rights would enable long-run, small-scale, mutually-beneficial transactions between humans and AIs. This would, we show, facilitate a peaceful strategic equilibrium between humans and AIs for the same reasons economic interdependence tends to promote peace in international relations. "
