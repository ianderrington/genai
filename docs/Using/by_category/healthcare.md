- [Health system-scale language models are all-purpose prediction engines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06160-y) Uses LLM based system to integrate real time clinical workflows with note-writing and electronic ordering. Generally quite-performant and. a great indication of how they could be used to predict things such as readmission rates, and many other applications.
