??? tip "[Genome-wide prediction of disease variant effects with a deep protein language model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01465-0) 'A Model that predects bad genetic variants'"
    Here we implemented a workflow generalizing ESM1b to protein sequences of any length and used it to predict all ~450 million possible missense variant effects across all 42,336 protein isoforms in the human genome.

## Fields
Here are a few fields where Gen()AI is already having formative impacts. 

### Robotics

- [CLAIRIFY](https://ac-rad.github.io/clairify/) Translates English to domain-specific languages like robots. 
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14100
- [RT-2](https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/assets/rt2.pdf) An impressive demonstration of multi-step fusing (PaLI-X) and Pathways Language model Embodied (PaLM-E) as components of it. 

### Science

### Chemistry

??? tip "[Grammar-Induced Geometry for Data-Efficient Molecular Property Prediction](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SGQi3LgFnqj) IMPORTANT uses heirarchichal metagraphs to stitch-together molecular nodes. " 
    This results in leaves that are 'actual' molecules. Using graph neural-diffusion, it does amazingly well even with minimal data-sets (100 examples).

## Societal simulations

- [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf): 
  They gave 25 AI agents motivations & memory, and put them in a simulated town. Not only did they engage in complex behavior.The actions were rated more human than humans roleplaying.
