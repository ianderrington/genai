There is a notable degree of concern for the potential for Generative, and eventually General AI, to cause harm. The harm can occur either accidentally or to the intentional use of GenAI. 

There is also self-existenial concerns related to GenAI models themselves. This is found due to the potential that when models are trained on data that is produced by other models, there can be a degredation in performance, known as _model collapse_.
