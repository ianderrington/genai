TODO: This section needs complete remodeling.

Raw generative models do not generally produce globally accurate outputs given input prompts. 

This is due to the manner of training and next-word-prediction (or more arbitrary masked-word prediction) is probabilistically 'greedy'. Namely, within a sampling of outputs, the next-prediction will be sampled based on their _immediate_ likelihood. To improve the outputs, the models are further refined using various approaches. These approaches 'align' the output to accurately considered

There is a notable degree of concern for the potential for Generative, and eventually General AI, to cause harm. The harm can occur either accidentally or to the intentional use of GenAI.

There is also self-existential concerns related to GenAI models themselves. This is found due to the potential that when models are trained on data that is produced by other
models, there can be a degradation in performance, known as _model collapse_.
