Gen()AI has increasing value when it can be integrated with software UI that people are already familiar with. With greater familiarity, these tools can be quickly used without incurring switching costs associated with using new UIs. While it is likely most interfaces will be connected to GenAI, via different levels of OS-enablement, here we share some that are particularly useful.

## Closed Source
The integrations with closed source systems are myriad. Because interfacing is key, those interfaces that already exist can be augmented with AI to improve the manner tha people work with them.
