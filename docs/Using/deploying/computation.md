# Computation in AI Deployment

Computation plays a crucial role in the deployment of AI models. It involves various aspects such as latency, load, batching, memory, and other requirements that are necessary to have an effective backend. Understanding these computational aspects can help in optimizing the performance of AI models during deployment.

## Latency

Latency refers to the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer. In AI deployment, low latency is often desirable as it means faster response times.

## Load

Load refers to the amount of computational work that a computer system can perform. High loads can slow down the system and affect the performance of the AI model.

## Batching

Batching is a process of grouping a number of similar tasks together and executing them all at once. In the context of AI, batching can help in improving the efficiency of the model by processing multiple data points at once.

## Memory

Memory is a crucial aspect of computation. It is where the data is stored for processing. Adequate memory is necessary for the smooth functioning of AI models.

## Other Requirements

There are other requirements as well that are necessary for effective backend. These include a good network connection, sufficient storage space, and a powerful processing unit.

## Tutorials

## Essential Reading Material

Creating models in AI involves large volumes of matrix multiplication. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are designed for this purpose as they can process multiple computations simultaneously. For a deeper understanding of how GPUs aid in deep learning, refer to the following resource:
