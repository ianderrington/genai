There are a vast number of both open and closed-source models that can be used. A number of them can be downloaded and run on the appropriate hardware, others may be accessed through APIs. 

It is essential to [compare and evaluate](evaluating_and_comparing.md) the models for your intended use-cases to ensure they meet technical, customer, and organizational requirements. 

## Leaderboards and comparisons

Here are a few boards that help to aggregate and test models that have been released. 

- [Hugging Face LLM leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) An essential chart for documenting the model performance across multiple models.
