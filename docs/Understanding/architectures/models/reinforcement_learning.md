Reinforcement learning is a class of of ML that uses dynamic feedback from environments to enable more successful outcomes.

MANAGEN TODO: Insert general description in here. 

In the context of Generative AI, it may be considered that each token that is generated is an action taken in the state-space of tokens. Consequenetly, RL has been used as a method for improving, other Geerative models using [feedback](../training/feedback.md) methods. 

## Notable research

??? tip "[Learning to Model the World with Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01399.pdf) Uses multimodal agents to build world models to act in."
    Also introduces Homegrid evaluation game. Fun continuous multimodal agent. [Github](https://github.com/jlin816/dynalang)
