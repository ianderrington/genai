Reinforcement learning is a class of of ML that uses dynamic feedback from environments to enable more successful outcomes.

MANAGEN TODO: Insert general description in here. 

In the context of Generative AI, it may be considered that each token that is generated is an action taken in the state-space of tokens. Consequenetly, RL has been used as a method for improving, other Geerative models using [feedback](../training/feedback.md) methods.
