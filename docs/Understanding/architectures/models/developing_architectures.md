Here we share novel and promising architectures that may supplement or supplant other presently established models.

### Structured State Space Sequence Models (SSSSMs)

Structured state space sequence models are a class of models that generally combine RNNs, convolutions with inspiration from state-space methods.

Well-known methods include:

### MambaByte

Operating on bytes directly instead of relying on encoding representation and subword tokenization and modality offers models greater flexability and versatility. Attending to the increased context length, which has been enabled by SSSSMs

??? code "[Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba)"
    Their method provides potential highly parallelizable that operates on very long contexts.
