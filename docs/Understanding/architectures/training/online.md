## Online Training


??? abstract "[Online-LoRA](ttps://github.com/christina200/online-lora-official)" online-lora
    The authors provide code and show in [their paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05663) a manner of enabling online-lora to finetune pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT)s in real time, thereby addressing the issues with reherasl buffers. They use dynamic loss values to ensure automatic recognition of data distribution shipfts and a novel online weight regularization strategy for combining different model parameters.
