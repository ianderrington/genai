# Orchestration

## Interaction and Orchestration Frameworks and SDKs

Handling the inputs/outputs to GenAI in a consistent and reliable manner has spurred the creation of software libraries that can work with GenAI that is called as a service, or hosted locally.

### LangChain
LangChain is an open source SDK that allows for creation and management of chat and RAG based interactions. It has a large user community emphasizing extensions to multiple types of models and documents. It has enterprise offerings with LangSmith for observability, LangServe for serving. It also can enable multi-agent interactions with LangGraph.
