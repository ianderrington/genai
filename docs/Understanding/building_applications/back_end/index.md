# Back-End Infrastructure for AI Applications

Deploying AI models requires careful consideration of backend infrastructure - the engine that powers your AI application. This guide covers the key aspects of backend deployment and available tools.

## Core Components

### Computation and Resources
For detailed information about computational resources, hardware requirements, and optimization strategies, see our [computation guide](computation.md).

### Model Operations
For comprehensive coverage of model deployment, monitoring, and management, see our [LLM Operations guide](llm_ops/index.md).

### Pre-trained Models
For information about available models, their characteristics, and selection criteria, see our [pre-trained models guide](pre_trained_models.md).

### Orchestration
For details about frameworks and tools for managing AI workflows, see our [orchestration guide](orchestrating.md).

### Data Processing
For information about data handling in backend systems, see our [data processing guide](data.md).
