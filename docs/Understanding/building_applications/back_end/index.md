# Backend Infrastructure for AI Applications

Deploying AI models requires careful consideration of backend infrastructure - the engine that powers your AI application. This guide covers the key aspects of backend deployment and available tools.

## Core Considerations

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: The delay between request and response. Critical for real-time applications and user experience.
- **Throughput**: The number of requests that can be processed per unit time.
- **Model Quality**: The accuracy and reliability of model outputs for your specific use case.

For detailed information about computational resources and optimization, see our [computation guide](computation.md).
