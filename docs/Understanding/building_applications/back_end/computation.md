# Computation Requirements

This guide covers the computational aspects of AI model deployment, focusing on hardware utilization and optimization strategies. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for efficient and cost-effective AI deployment.

## Hardware Architecture

### GPU Components

- **Parallel Processing Units**: Specialized for matrix operations, enabling thousands of simultaneous calculations
- **Tensor Cores**: Hardware accelerators designed specifically for AI workloads, offering up to 8x speedup for matrix operations
- **Memory Hierarchy**: 

  - High Bandwidth Memory (HBM): Ultra-fast main GPU memory (up to 2TB/s)
  - L2 Cache: Shared intermediate storage
  - Shared Memory: Fast per-block memory
  - Register File: Fastest, per-thread storage

- **Memory Bandwidth**: Critical for model performance, typically 1-2TB/s in modern GPUs

### CPU vs GPU Considerations

- CPUs excel at sequential tasks and complex logic
- GPUs are optimal for parallel matrix operations
- Hybrid approaches often yield best results
- Consider CPU for preprocessing and orchestration

## Workload Types and Requirements

### Inference

- Lower memory requirements than training
- Emphasis on latency and throughput
- Supports lower precision (FP16, INT8) with minimal accuracy loss
- Optimal for batching to maximize throughput
- Key metrics: requests/second, latency percentiles

### Fine-tuning
- Moderate memory requirements
- Higher precision needs (FP32) for stable training
- Distributed training capable
- Memory optimization via gradient accumulation
- Important factors: dataset size, learning rate, batch size

### Pre-training
- Highest resource demands
- Requires distributed infrastructure
- Significant storage needs for datasets
- Long-running workloads (weeks to months)
- Critical: checkpoint management, fault tolerance

## Resource Requirements

### GPU Memory Estimation
For quick estimation of GPU requirements:

#### Inference
$$ \text{Number of GPUs} \approx \frac{\text{model\_parameters (billions)} \times \text{precision (bytes)}}{\text{gpu\_memory (GB)}} $$

#### Training
$$ \text{Number of GPUs} \approx 6 \times \frac{\text{model\_parameters (billions)} \times \text{precision (bytes)}}{\text{gpu\_memory (GB)}} $$

Where:
- `precision` is typically:
  - FP32 (4 bytes): Higher accuracy, training
  - FP16 (2 bytes): Balanced performance/accuracy
  - INT8 (1 byte): High-performance inference
- Training multiplier (~6x) accounts for:
  - Optimizer states (2x)
  - Gradients (1x)
  - Forward activations (1x)
  - Temporary buffers (2x)
- Additional considerations:
  - Batch size impacts memory linearly
  - Attention mechanisms scale quadratically with sequence length
  - Framework overhead varies (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)

## Optimization Strategies

### Memory Optimization
- **Model Quantization**: 
  - Reduces precision while maintaining accuracy
  - Common formats: FP16, BF16, INT8
  - Post-training vs. quantization-aware training
- **Gradient Accumulation**: 
  - Splits large batches into micro-batches
  - Trades speed for memory efficiency
- **Model Sharding**: 
  - Distributes model across devices
  - Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) stages
- **KV Cache Management**: 
  - Crucial for transformer inference
  - Sliding window approaches
  - Structured state pruning

### Compute Optimization

- **Batching Strategies**: 

  - Dynamic batching for varied input sizes
  - Automatic batch size selection
  - Priority-based scheduling

- **Mixed Precision Training**: 

  - FP16/BF16 computation with FP32 master weights
  - Automatic loss scaling

- **Parallel Processing**:

  - Tensor Parallelism: splits individual tensors
  - Pipeline Parallelism: splits model layers
  - Data Parallelism: splits batch processing
  - Hybrid approaches for optimal scaling
