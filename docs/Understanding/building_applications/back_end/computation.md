# Computation and Hardware Architecture

## Hardware Architecture

### GPU Components
- **Parallel Processing Units**: 
    - Specialized for matrix operations, enabling thousands of simultaneous calculations
    - CUDA cores for general compute
    - RT cores for ray tracing (useful in some AI visualization tasks)
- **Tensor Cores**: 
    - Hardware accelerators designed specifically for AI workloads
    - Up to 8x speedup for matrix operations
    - Generational improvements (Ampere, Ada Lovelace architectures)
- **Memory Hierarchy**: 
    - High Bandwidth Memory (HBM): Ultra-fast main GPU memory (up to 2TB/s)
    - L2 Cache: Shared intermediate storage (up to 96MB in modern GPUs)
    - Shared Memory: Fast per-block memory (configurable with L1 cache)
    - Register File: Fastest, per-thread storage
- **Memory Bandwidth**: 
    - Critical for model performance, typically 1-2TB/s in modern GPUs
    - PCIe bandwidth considerations for multi-GPU setups
    - NVLink for high-speed GPU-to-GPU communication

### CPU vs GPU Considerations
- CPUs excel at:
    - Sequential tasks and complex logic
    - Dynamic control flow
    - System management and I/O
    - Small batch inference
- GPUs optimal for:
    - Parallel matrix operations
    - Large batch processing
    - Regular computation patterns
    - High throughput inference
- Hybrid approaches often yield best results:
    - CPU for preprocessing and orchestration
    - GPU for model computation
    - Balanced memory management
    - Efficient data transfer strategies

## Workload Types and Requirements

### Inference
- Lower memory requirements than training
- Emphasis on latency and throughput
- Supports lower precision (FP16, INT8) with minimal accuracy loss
- Optimization techniques:
    - Batching to maximize throughput
    - Dynamic batch sizing
    - Kernel fusion
    - Attention caching
- Key metrics: 
    - Requests/second
    - Latency percentiles
    - Memory utilization
    - Cost per inference

### Fine-tuning
- Moderate memory requirements
- Higher precision needs (FP32) for stable training
- Distributed training capable
- Memory optimization via gradient accumulation
- Important factors:
    - Dataset size and quality
    - Learning rate scheduling
    - Batch size optimization
    - Checkpoint strategy
    - Validation frequency

### Pre-training
- Highest resource demands
- Requires distributed infrastructure
- Significant storage needs for datasets
- Long-running workloads (weeks to months)
- Critical considerations:
    - Checkpoint management
    - Fault tolerance
    - Data pipeline efficiency
    - Distributed training strategy
    - Cost optimization

## Resource Requirements

### GPU Memory Estimation
For quick estimation of GPU requirements:

#### Inference
$$ \text{Number of GPUs} \approx \frac{\text{model\_parameters (billions)} \times \text{precision (bytes)}}{\text{gpu\_memory (GB)}} $$

#### Training
$$ \text{Number of GPUs} \approx 6 \times \frac{\text{model\_parameters (billions)} \times \text{precision (bytes)}}{\text{gpu\_memory (GB)}} $$

**Key Parameters**:

- `precision` typically:
    - FP32 (4 bytes): Higher accuracy, training
    - FP16 (2 bytes): Balanced performance/accuracy
    - INT8 (1 byte): High-performance inference
    - Mixed precision: Combines multiple formats
- Training multiplier (~6x) accounts for:
    - Optimizer states (2x)
    - Gradients (1x)
    - Forward activations (1x)
    - Temporary buffers (2x)
- Additional considerations:
    - Batch size impacts memory linearly
    - Attention mechanisms scale quadratically with sequence length
    - Framework overhead varies (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)
    - Memory fragmentation overhead
