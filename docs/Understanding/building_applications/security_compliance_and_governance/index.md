# Security, Compliance, and Governance

Building AI applications requires careful attention to security, compliance, and governance. This guide covers essential practices and considerations for developing secure and compliant AI systems.

## Overview

- [Security](security.md): Best practices for securing AI applications and infrastructure
- [Compliance](compliance.md): Regulatory requirements and industry standards
- [Governance](governance.md): Organizational structure and policy frameworks
- [Monitoring](monitoring.md): System observability and performance tracking

## Core Components

### [Security](security.md)
- Access control and authentication
- Data protection and privacy
- Model security and robustness
- Infrastructure security

### [Compliance](compliance.md)
- Regulatory requirements
- Industry standards
- Documentation and reporting
- Audit trails

### [Governance](governance.md)
- Policy frameworks
- Decision-making processes
- Risk management
- Ethical considerations

### [Monitoring](monitoring.md)
- System metrics and observability
- Performance tracking
- Alerting and incident response
- Analytics and reporting

## Human-in-the-Loop

Human oversight is essential, and often legally required, for important AI processes. This section covers approaches to incorporating human judgment and control in AI systems.

### Tools and Frameworks

!!! abstract "[HumanLayer](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer)"
    A Python and TypeScript toolkit enabling AI agents to communicate with humans in tool-based and asynchronous workflows. Incorporating humans-in-the-loop allows agentic tools to access more powerful capabilities while maintaining oversight.

### Implementation Patterns

- **Review Workflows**: Processes for human review of AI outputs
- **Intervention Points**: Strategic points for human oversight
- **Feedback Loops**: Systems for incorporating human feedback
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear paths for handling edge cases
