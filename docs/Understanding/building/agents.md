    **Developments** In their [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08435) the authors revealmeta-agents that observe adn critique prompting nd efforts to enable better agents. In their own words: 
    > "The core concept of Meta Agent Search is to instruct a meta agent to iteratively create interestingly new agents, evaluate them, add them to an archive that stores discovered agents, and use this archive to help the meta agent in subsequent iterations create yet more interestingly new agents."

    ```markdown "MAIN PROMPT"
    You are an expert machine learning researcher testing different agentic systems.
    [Brief Description of the Domain]
    [Framework Code]
    [Output Instructions and Examples]
    [Discovered Agent Archive] (initialized with baselines, updated at every iteration)
    # Your task
    You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. Your goal is
    to maximize the performance by proposing interestingly new agents ......
    Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next
    interesting agentic system design.

## Platforms and systems for building agents

These are platforms with varying degrees of features and elements that can enable the building of agents with either/or APIs and low-code solutions.
