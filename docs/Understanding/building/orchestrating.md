#### Orchestration


### Interaction and Orchestration Frameworks and SDKs

Handling the inputs/outputs to GenAI in a consistent and reliable manner has spurred the creation of software libraries that can work with GenAI that is called as a service, or hosted locally.

#### LangChain
Langchain is an open source SDK that allows for creation and management of chat and RAG based interactions. It has a Large user community emphasizing extensions to multiple types of models and documents. It has entrprise offerings with Langsmith for observability, Langserve for serving. It alos can enable multi-agent interactions with lang-graph. 

!!! tip "[Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/#) Is a thorough python and javascript orchestration language for adaptable, memory and tooling-equipped calls that can enable agentic AI."

!!! tip "![GitHub Repo stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/langchain-ai/langserve) [LangServe](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langserve) will provide a hosted version of LangServe for one-click deployments of LangChain applications."
