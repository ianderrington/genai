#### Orchestration

??? code "[EmbedChain](https://github.com/embedchain/embedchain)  is a framework to easily create LLM powered bots over any dataset."
    Example:
    ```python
        import os

        from embedchain import Llama2App

        os.environ['REPLICATE_API_TOKEN'] = "REPLICATE API TOKEN"

        zuck_bot = Llama2App()

        # Embed your data
        zuck_bot.add("youtube_video", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ")
        zuck_bot.add("web_page", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg")

        # Nice, your bot is ready now. Start asking questions to your bot.
        zuck_bot.query("Who is Mark Zuckerberg?")
        # Answer: Mark Zuckerberg is an American internet entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the co-founder and CEO of Facebook.
    ```

## Monitoring Gen()AI
For reasons related to quality, ethics, and regulation, it is both useful, and at times required, to record both inputs, and outputs from an LLM. Particularly in systems that may be used in non low-risk settings, monitoring is an essential component of Gen()AI.  Also known as _LLM observability_, monitoring can people-in-the-loop, as well as automated systems to observe and adapt the system to both inputs and outputs that are undesired or dangerous.
