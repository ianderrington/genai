When an agent (or model) engages in an interaction with another agent, the result is an agent system. This is achieved by implementing and equipping various agents, and then setting them up so that the output of one is used as the input of the other. Although one may argue that an agent's input can be perceived as another 'tool' where the different agent prompts the action, this argument isn't entirely valid. The reason is that, in most cases, the same considerations apply to all agents but not to all tools. Therefore, we deal with it separately.

!!! note "Binary system (asymmetric calling)"
    In this system, ChatGPT initiates communication with DallE using a prompt. DallE responds by delivering an image. This image is then used in the final response of ChatGPT or returned as-is.

        
!!! note "Multi-body system (bidirectional calling)"
    This system consists of multiple agents, and they engage in ongoing discussions about their daily activities. They also receive regular updates about their environment. An example of this type of system can be viewed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf).

??? tip "[Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf) in a simulated town!!!"
    This paper discusses a simulation involving different agents exhibiting different personalities. The dynamic environment, shared in [code](https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town) can be manipulated by these agents. The paper explores various challenges and proposed solutions including:
    ```markdown
    **Remembering**
        _Observation Memory_ This is a memory stream that maintains a record of past experiences. These experiences are stored in "memory objects", which are described in natural language, and timestamped. The importance of each memory object is determined using metrics such as _recency_, _importance_, and _relevance_. 
        _Reflection Memory_ This memory type allows the agent to generate more abstract thoughts. These thoughts can be included along with reflections. This process is hardcoded to occur when the sum of importance scores exceeds a certain threshold.
    **Planning and Reacting**
        _Recursive Planning_ In this process, the agent divides the day into chunks of "goals", which are further broken down into smaller time frames. The ability to adjust these plans based on interactions is a key feature of this mechanism.
    ```

    This work illuminates optimization techniques for multi-agents using distributed reward systems to achieve state-of-the-art performance. It introduces a joint optimization approach that depends on _self_ and _interactive_ terms.

    They tried both concatenation or _summarization_ of other results. Summarization reduces length and improves quality. 
    ```python
        # Debate Length Prompt
        short_prompt = """ These are the solutions to the problem from other agents: {other_answers}
            Based off the opinion of other agents, can you give an updated response . . ."""
        long_prompt = """ These are the solutions to the problem from other agents: {other_answers}
            Using the opinion of other agents as additional advice, can you give an updated response . . ."""
