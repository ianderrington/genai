Actions and tools, also called 'plugins', can be considered function calls to routines external to the LLM. Relayed by an [interpreters and routers](#interpeters-and), these have made LLMs one of the most powerful enablers of Agentic AI. 

## Actions and tools

Tools generally consist of single function calls to something that will return value to the end-point destination, be that the agent itself or a person interacting with an agent.
Actions can be thought of interacting in an environment, this environment can have external 'tools' or some form of digital or physical embodiment state of the agent. Thhought of in a different way, actions may be be internal or externally focused.  focused generally related to an agent's '`memory`, or externally focused, with tools, though their distinction may be moot.

**Internal actions** generally relate reading, writing or updating, an agents memory, [memory](./memory.md) state, such as free-text `scratech-pad`, an ordered `memory-log` or a vector database.

**External actions** may be to act on simulated or real environments, or otherwise tracked `state`, or to use a toolthat an agent may be 'equipped with' to run. These can be API calls or local function calls.



### Libraries

??? tip "[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)" mcp
    MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs, similar to how USB-C connects devices. It enables seamless integration of LLMs with various data sources and tools, offering pre-built integrations, flexibility in switching LLM providers, and best practices for data security.

### Executors

The action that an agent may take is enabled by an `AgentExecutor` which can also be considered an [environment](./environments.md) of the LLM output, that coordinates the call to perform the action.

###  Interpeters and Routers

Interpreters are programs that facilitate model computation by parsing, formatting, or otherwise preparing the data for effective use. They can also be used to route information to the appropriate reciever, such as a tool or other LLM. 

Interpreting Such efforts can be used to reduce input complexity, token-count, to detect potentially unreasonable inputs or outputs. These interpreters _may_ be agents or models themselves, thought that is not required.

!!! example "Link Routing"
    A model may not be guaranteed to produce equivalent output based on a complex input string such as an html address. Consequently, pre-parsing the output and substituting a simple name for an address, such as 'html_1', and then re-introducing that within any output, both using RegEx, may enable more effective output.
