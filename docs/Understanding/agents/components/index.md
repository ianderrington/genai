# Components

AI agents are complex systems made up of several essential components that work together to enable intelligent behavior. Each component serves a specific purpose and contributes to the agent's overall capabilities:

- [Cognitive Architecture](cognitive_architecture.md) - How agents think, reason, and make decisions
- [Memory](memory.md) - How agents store and recall information
- [Actions and Tools](actions_and_tools.md) - How agents interact with the world
- [Environments](environments.md) - The contexts in which agents operate

These components form the foundation of any AI agent system, whether simple or complex. Understanding how they work together is crucial for building effective AI applications.
