    **Development**
    Easy Tool follows a simple pattern of: 1. Task Planning, 2. Tool Retrieval, 3. Tool Selection and 4. Tool Execution, coupled with thoughtful prompting to enable SOT tool usage over multiple models. 

    **Problem**
    Using new tools, software,  especially can be challenging for LLMs (and people too!), especially with a poor or redundant documentation and a variety of usage manners.

    **Solution**
    Easy tool provides "a simple method to condense tool documentation into more concise and effective tool instructions."

    ```markdown
         I: Tool Description Generation
         /* I: Task prompt */
         Your task is to create a concise and effective tool usage description based on the tool documentation. You should ensure the description only contains the purposes of the
         tool without irrelevant information. Here is an example:
         /* Examples */
         {Tool Documentation}
         Tool usage description:
         {Tool_name} is a tool that can {General_Purposes}.
         This tool has {Number} multiple built-in functions:
         1. {Function_1} is to {Functionality_of_Function_1} 2. {Function_2} is to ...
         /* Auto generation of tool description */ {ToolDocumentationof‚ÄòAviationWeatherCenter‚Äô} Tool usage description:
         ‚ÄòAviation Weather Center‚Äô is a tool which can provide official aviation weather data...
         II: Tool Function Guidelines Construction
         /* Task prompt */
         Your task is to create the scenario that will use the tool.
         1. You are given a tool with its purpose and its parameters list. The scenario should adopt the parameters in the list.
         2. If the parameters and parameters are both null, you
         should set: {"Scenario": XX, "Parameters":{}}.
         Here is an example:
         /* Examples */
         {Tool_name} is a tool that can {General_Purposes}. {Function_i} is to {Functionality_of_Function_i} {Parameter List of Function_i}
         One scenario for {Function_i} of {Tool_name} is: {"Scenario": XX, "Parameters":{XX:XX}}
         /* Auto-construction for Tool Function Guidelines */
         ‚ÄòEbay‚Äô can get products from Ebay in a specific country. ‚ÄòProduct Details‚Äô in ‚ÄòEbay‚Äô can get the product details for a given product id and a specific country.
         {Parameter List of ‚ÄòProduct Details‚Äô}
         One scenario for ‚ÄòProduct Details‚Äô of ‚ÄòEbay‚Äô is:
         {"Scenario": "if you want to know the details of the product with product ID 1954 in Germany from Ebay", "Parameters":{"product_id": 1954, "country": "Germany"}}.
    ```

??? important "[Hugging GPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580)" hugging-gpt
    
    **Development** 
    
    Hugging GPT enables LLM models to call other models via the Hugging Face Repo
    
    **Problem**
    
    LLMs are not the best task for all tasks. Enabling LLMS to use task-specific models can improve the quality of the results.
    
    **Solution**
    Hugging GPT provides an intervace for LLMs by breaking it down into 1. Task Planning, 2. Model Selection, 3. Task Execution, and 4. Response Generation

    **Results**
    The results provide substiantial evidence that HuggingGPT can enable successful single, sequential, and graph-based tasks.

    # Your task
    You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. Your goal is
    to maximize the performance by proposing interestingly new agents ......
    Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next
    interesting agentic system design.

## Platforms and systems for building agents

These are platforms with varying degrees of features and elements that can enable the building of agents with either/or APIs and low-code solutions.
