Models provide the computational core of Agents. Acting like a 'brain' that takes in input [prompts](#prompts) they return outputs. Generally, the models may be considered `frozen` for a given agent, but sometimes, agentic feedback is used for helping model creation with [recurrent training](../architectures/recurrent_training.md).

[Here](../architectures/index.md) you can learn how to build models, though it is often easier to use [pre-trained models](../architectures/pre_trained_models.md).
