# Types of Agents

Types of agents are defined by their capabilities and the environment they operate in.

1. Chat-based Agents: Can answer questions, provide information, and engage in conversation.
2. Autonomous Task Agents: Can perform simple or complex tasks, such as writing code, designing websites, or managing finances. They generally operate in web browsers or computers, but can also be in VMs. 
3. Multi-Agent Systems: Can collaborate with other agents to achieve complex goals.
4. Embodied Agents: Can interact with the physical world, such as robots or autonomous vehicles.
