Agent types can be described by direct agentic ability to cause a change in the world.

## Text Agent

An agent that can output only language text. Even thought the language can be 'interpreted' into different things, as is done in the environment. 

## Text + Image Agent

An agent that can output 

## Robotic Agent

A robotic agent can control mechanism impacting the mechanical position or other activity of a device.

    [Website](https://posgnu.github.io/rci-web/), [GitHub](https://github.com/posgnu/rci-agent)  Combining with Chain of Thought it is even better. The method: Plan: Critique, Improve 
    - Explicit RCI: "Review your previous answer and find problems with your answer." --> "Based on the problems you found, improve your answer." Recursively Criticizes and Improves its output. This sort of prompting outperforms Chain of Thought, and combined it works even better.
