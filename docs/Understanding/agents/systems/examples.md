# Agent System Examples

## Collaborative Development Systems
Examples of agent systems working together to develop software and solutions.

??? abstract "ChatDev - Collaborative Software Development"
    [ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev) is a communicative agent approach for developing solutions using ML models. It works with Camel to create agentic systems and provides a framework for creating systems of agents to produce software-enabled products.

??? important "Experiential Co-Learning of Software-Developing Agents"
    This [system](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17025.pdf) introduces a multi-agent paradigm with three key modules:
    - **Co-tracking**: Promotes interactive rehearsals between agents
    - **Co-memorizing**: Finds shortcuts based on past experiences
    - **Co-reasoning**: Enhances instructions using collective experience pools

## Task-Specific Agent Teams

??? abstract "Polaris - Healthcare Safety System"
    [Polaris](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.13313v1) is a safety-focused LLM constellation architecture for healthcare, ensuring safe and compliant AI chatbots through multi-agent collaboration.

??? tip "Showrunner Agents - Content Generation"
    [Showrunner Agents](https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/) use LLMs to generate episodic content through a creative and multi-faceted process.

??? abstract "MAgICoRe - Reasoning Framework"
    [MAgICoRe](https://github.com/dinobby/MAgICoRe) implements a multi-agent system with solver, reviewer, and refiner roles to enable improved solutions through collaborative refinement.

## Learning and Teaching Systems

??? tip "Theory of Mind Teaching"
    [This research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09299.pdf) explores how language models can teach weaker agents using Theory of Mind concepts to improve student performance. [Implementation](https://github.com/swarnaHub/ExplanationIntervention)

??? tip "Multi-Agent Debate for Improvement"
    [This approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14325.pdf) uses multiple language model instances to debate and refine responses, improving factuality and reasoning through collaborative critique.

## Production Systems

??? abstract "Agency Swarm - Production Framework"
    [Agency Swarm](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm) provides a language for creating interacting systems of agents in production environments.

??? abstract "Council - Team Orchestration"
    [Council](https://github.com/chain-ml/council) enables the creation of networks of agents to form full-fledged teams for production outputs.

??? tip "OpenAI Assistants"
    OpenAI's [AI assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) system allows integration of different assistants within a chat using the `@` symbol, enabling collaborative problem-solving.

## Research Implementations

??? tip "Generative Agents Simulation"
    [This research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf) implements a simulated town where agents with different personalities interact and evolve. Key features include:
    - Observation and reflection memory systems
    - Recursive planning capabilities
    - Dynamic environment interactions
    [Implementation](https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town)

??? abstract "SocraticAI - Conversational Problem Solving"
    [SocraticAI](https://github.com/RunzheYang/SocraticAI) leverages the power of conversation between agents to solve complex problems through structured dialogue.

??? tip "Society of Minds"
    Based on Minsky's theory, this [research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17066.pdf) implements a multi-agent debate approach where agents collectively review and refine answers through structured interaction.

## Emerging Architectures

??? abstract "Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (HAAS)"
    [HAAS](https://github.com/daveshap/OpenAI_Agent_Swarm) implements self-directing, self-correcting, and self-improving agent systems through hierarchical organization.

??? tip "Swarm Intelligence Systems"
    [Swarms](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms) explores large-scale agent coordination, focusing on emergent behaviors and collective intelligence in multi-agent systems.
