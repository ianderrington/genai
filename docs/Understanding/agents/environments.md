Environments consist of the information that agents have access too as well as 'what can be done' to influence the environment. An environment sends information that an agent can receive. 

The origin of the information can be 'a person' or a 'data stream' that is based in real-measurements, or a simulation. 

!!! example "A chat-environment"
    In a chat environment the GenAI receives text information from a user and then returns text information that is printed for the user to read.

!!! example "A town simulation"
    In [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf) A town is simulated to provide observable information and an interaction world with/between other agents. 

!!! example "A camera and microphone"
    As may be needed for a robot, a camera, and a microphone provide the inputs for the environment that it exists in. The signals received (and processes) only represent a portion of what might potentially be received.
