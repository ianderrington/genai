# Agent Optimization Methods



## Planning Optimization

### 1. Plan Generation Improvements

- Write better system prompts with more examples
- Provide clearer tool descriptions and parameters
- Refactor complex functions into simpler ones
- Use stronger models for planning tasks
- Finetune models specifically for plan generation

### 2. Plan Validation

- Implement heuristic checks for invalid actions
- Use AI-based plan evaluation
- Add human oversight for critical operations
- Validate plans before execution
- Generate multiple plans in parallel for comparison

### 3. Control Flow Optimization

Different execution patterns to consider:
- **Sequential**: Actions executed one after another
- **Parallel**: Multiple actions executed simultaneously
- **Conditional**: Branching based on previous results
- **Iterative**: Repeated actions until conditions are met

## Tool Usage Optimization

### 1. Tool Selection

- Compare agent performance with different tool sets
- Conduct ablation studies to identify essential tools
- Monitor tool usage patterns and errors
- Plot distribution of tool calls
- Remove unused or problematic tools

### 2. Tool Integration

- Standardize tool interfaces
- Implement proper error handling
- Add input validation
- Monitor tool performance
- Document tool usage patterns

### 3. Tool Composition

- Identify frequently combined tools
- Create composite tools for common patterns
- Implement tool transition tracking
- Build skill libraries for reuse

## Error Handling and Recovery

### 1. Planning Failures
Monitor and address:

- Invalid tool selection
- Incorrect parameter usage
- Goal misalignment
- Time constraint violations
- Reflection errors

### 2. Tool Failures

Handle common issues:

- Tool output accuracy
- Translation errors
- Missing tool detection
- Integration issues

### 3. Efficiency Metrics
Track and optimize:

- Average steps per task
- Cost per task completion
- Action latency
- Resource utilization

## Reflection and Self-Improvement

### 1. Implementation Strategies

- Interleave reasoning and action
- Add self-critique prompts
- Implement specialized scorers
- Use multi-agent evaluation

### 2. Evaluation Points

Add reflection at key stages:

- After receiving user queries
- After initial plan generation
- After each execution step
- After plan completion

### 3. Learning from Mistakes

- Analyze failure patterns
- Generate improvement suggestions
- Update tool selection
- Refine planning strategies

## Cost-Performance Optimization

### 1. Latency Management

- Balance planning and execution time
- Implement parallel processing where possible
- Cache common operations
- Optimize tool response times

### 2. Resource Usage

- Monitor API costs
- Track token usage
- Optimize context window usage
- Balance model strength vs cost

### 3. Quality vs Speed

Consider tradeoffs between:

- Detailed vs high-level planning
- Sequential vs parallel execution
- Single vs multiple plan generation
- Human oversight vs automation
