Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to increase the quality and/or diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. 

## What is Data Augmentation?

Data augmentation is a process of creating new data from the existing data for model [pre-training](../../architectures/training/pre-training.md) and [fine-tuning](../../architectures/training/fine-tuning.md). It is a form of [synthetic data](simulation.md) generation that can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models. The main idea behind data augmentation is to create variations in or structure from original data, that can capture different perspectives and scenarios, thereby enriching the dataset. Data augmentation has shown direct value in nearly all domains and modalities it has been explored in. 

### Why is Data Augmentation Important?

Data augmentation is important for several reasons:

1. **Improving Model Performance**: Data augmentation can help improve the performance of models by providing more varied data, and more consistently clean and regular data for training. This can help the model learn more embeddings and reduce the impact of lower quality data. 

2. **Dealing with Imbalanced Data**: In many real-world scenarios, the data we have is imbalanced. Data augmentation can help balance the dataset by creating synthetic data for under-represented domains and classes.

3. **Increasing Dataset Size**: Data augmentation can help increase the size of the dataset. This can be particularly useful when we have limited data for training our model.


!!! note
    The choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the type of data and the specific problem at hand. It is important to choose techniques that are relevant and meaningful for the given context.


## Types of Data Augmentation

Heuristic-based, and AI-enabled data augmentaion can be used to augment data.
