# Data Scraping

Data scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from various sources, typically websites, documents, or other digital formats. This technique is essential for gathering large amounts of data that would be impractical to collect manually.

## Common Scraping Methods

1. **Web Scraping**
   - HTML parsing
   - API consumption
   - Browser automation
   
2. **Document Scraping**
   - PDF extraction
   - Image text extraction (OCR)
   - Document format conversion

3. **Database Scraping**
   - Direct database queries
   - Export file processing
   - Log file analysis

## Tools and Libraries

### Web Scraping
- BeautifulSoup
- Scrapy
- Selenium
- Puppeteer

### Document Scraping
- MinerU
- Apache Tika
- Tabula
- PyMuPDF
