# Data Scraping

Data scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from various sources, typically websites, documents, or other digital formats. This technique is essential for gathering large amounts of data that would be impractical to collect manually.

## Common Scraping Methods

1. **Web Scraping**
   - HTML parsing
   - API consumption
   - Browser automation
   
2. **Document Scraping**
   - PDF extraction
   - Image text extraction (OCR)
   - Document format conversion

3. **Database Scraping**
   - Direct database queries
   - Export file processing
   - Log file analysis

## Scraping Practices

1. **Respect Rate Limits**
    - Implement delays between requests
    - Follow robots.txt guidelines
    - Use appropriate request headers

2. **Data Validation**
    - Verify extracted data integrity
    - Handle missing or malformed data
    - Implement error logging

3. **Performance Optimization**
    - Use async operations when possible
    - Implement proper caching
    - Consider distributed scraping for large datasets
