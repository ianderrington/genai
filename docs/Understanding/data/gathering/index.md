# Data Gathering

Data gathering is the foundation of any AI/ML project, requiring careful consideration of legal, ethical, and technical aspects to ensure high-quality, compliant datasets.

## Collection Methods

Data gathering encompasses various approaches:

1. **Automated Collection**
   - [Web scraping and crawling](scraping.md)
   - API integrations
   - Sensor data collection

2. **Manual Collection**
   - Surveys and forms
   - Human annotations
   - Expert labeling

3. **Existing Sources**
   - [Public datasets](sources.md)
   - Database querying
   - Document processing

## Key Considerations

### Legal Compliance
- Review terms of service and data usage agreements
- Respect copyright and intellectual property rights
- Adhere to licensing requirements
- Comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Respect the [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard) file
- Obtain necessary permissions and licenses

### Privacy and Ethics
- Protect personally identifiable information (PII)
- Implement data minimization principles
- Consider potential biases in data collection
- Ensure informed consent when applicable
- Maintain transparency about data collection methods
- Implement appropriate data security measures

### Technical Implementation
- Choose appropriate collection methods
- Ensure data quality and consistency
- Plan for scalability and storage
- Document data provenance
- Implement proper error handling
- Consider rate limiting and server load

## Best Practices

### Documentation
- Maintain detailed records of data sources
- Document collection methodologies
- Keep track of any data transformations
- Record version control and updates

### Risk Management
- Assess potential legal risks
- Evaluate technical limitations
- Consider ethical implications
- Plan for contingencies
- Monitor compliance requirements

### Resource Planning
- Estimate storage requirements
- Plan for processing capacity
- Consider bandwidth limitations
- Budget for API costs or licensing fees
- Account for maintenance overhead
