## What is this about?

Generative Artificial Intelligence, and related General AI and General Super AI are components of what already is and may be the future of intelligence üåü. We must effectively manage these technologies to use them to their highest potential.

To manage these technologies effectively and responsibly _we must understand them_ üöÄ. That is a complex task, especially given the speed at which we are generating novel insights, new discoveries, backed by increasingly powerful hardware. 

We created Managen AI üîÆ to help you _understand_ and [_use_](../Using/index.md) Gen()AI. 

What do you need to know?

???+ important "See these first" 
    - ü§î Understand [**use cases**](../Using/examples/index.md) and think of the [**challenges**](overview/gen_ai/considerations.md) associated with it. 
    - üìä Understand the [**data**](./data/index.md) and collect data that you need. 
    - üö¢ Consider [**Model Architectures**](./architectures/index.md) and use [**pre-trained models**](./architectures/models/index.md) if possible. 
    - üí¨ [**Prompts**](./prompting/index.md) govern how we interact with the models. 
    - üõ†Ô∏è [**Agents**](./agents/index.md) allow for models to be used in more useful, effective, and complex manners. 
    - üß≠ Consider [**Ethical concerns**](../Using/ethically/index.md) to ensure responsible use of these powerful technologies. 
    - üèóÔ∏è [**Building your solution**](./building_applications/index.md)

In the documents you read here, you will be able to see an increasingly consistent and understandable discussion of Gen()AI technologies, enabled by Gen()AI technologies herein described. Like most powerful technology, Gen()AI can be a two-edged sword and effective use requires responsible and thoughtful understanding. ‚öñÔ∏è

### How do you do stuff with Gen()AI?

üõ†Ô∏è As part of understanding, you'll learn a number of 'how-to's, in this section. You will also want to look at the [using guide](../Using/index.md) which will help you to directly use GenAI without needing to wade too-deeply into the complexities of research and engineering associated with Gen()AI. 

‚ææ Competition is fierce to create the 'best' (based on certain metrics) Gen()AI, so much knowledge may not be known to protect IP and other secrets.

Still, these trained foundation models may be used, with varying degrees of open-source licensing, for your project. Open and closed-source pre-trained [models](./building_applications/back_end/pre_trained_models.md) are available in many places that can be used hosted by yourself, or enabled by API services. Because of the cost and challenge involved with creating these models, it will likely be necessary to use the ones already made.

If you are working on commercial projects, be sure to look at the Licenses to ensure you are legally compliant.

üö® And please, whatever you do, be cognisant of the [ethical concerns](../Using/ethically/index.md) 

Generative AI is a subset of machine learning that aim to creates new data samples or information based on an input. This technology has gained significant attention recently because they have been able to produce high-quality, realistic data across various domains, from images and videos to text and audio. üåà

!!! warning "Presentation bias"
    This is presently highly [transformer-based large-language models](architectures/models/transformers.md) because language is presently more versatile than other modalities. Other models are discussed [here](architectures/models/index.md). Many other techniques and technologies may not have entered into this yet. If you'd like to help us build this right, please consider [contributing](../Managenai/contributing.md)
