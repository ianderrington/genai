STUB: 
This will provide information and references for base-level AI for more simplified understanding of the field



### Higher-level Frameworks
Higher level frameworks minimize the lines of code needed to make a model and keep track of everything.

- [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) Framework for boiler-plate minimal ML calling using pytorch. 

#### Lightning
- [Lightning + Hydra](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template) Uses the [lightning] framework with Hydra-based config management.
- [Lightning Hugging face adapter](https://github.com/mariomeissner/lightning-hydra-transformers/blob/main/src/architectures/hf_model.py)

## Must-have knowledge

## Network Figures

Being able to see the 'structure' of some neural networks make it easier to understand, and more aesthetic.

- [PlotNeuralNet](https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet) and a nice [writeup](https://pub.towardsai.net/creating-stunning-neural-network-visualizations-with-chatgpt-and-plotneuralnet-adab37589e5) on how to use it.
