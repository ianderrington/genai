Thhere are various activities and fields that leverage the capabilities of Generative AI.

## General Modalities

The following table provides an overview of the general modalities in which Generative AI can be applied:

| Modality | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Language | Spoken and Written |
| Time series | Music, Speech, Finances |
| Visual 2D | Images, Diagrams |
| Visual 3D | 3D Models, Virtual Reality |
| Visual 2D with time | Animated Graphics, Videos |
| Visual 3D with time | 3D Animations, Simulations |
| Graphical | Relation and Influence Networks |
| Generally linear sequences | Genome, Proteome |
| Multidimensional Temporal sequences | Weather, Brain Recordings, Stock Market |
| Multimodal variants | Combination of the above methods |

For a more detailed description of these modalities, refer to [this section](../../../Using/examples/by_modality/index.md).

## General Activities

Because at its core, GenAI works on Information, there are several fundamental ways in which Generative AI can be used. The application often depends on the [field](../../../Using/examples/by_field/index.md). Here are the core activities that can be used across many, if not all, fields of applications:

### Creating Information 

At its base, Generative AI is used to create information, such as new text or images. This creation can take several forms:

#### Expansion

- Generating larger outputs from small inputs
- Writing detailed documentation or articles
- Brainstorming and ideation
- Explaining complex concepts in detail
- Creating training data for other AI systems

#### Reasoning

- Evaluating trade-offs between different approaches
- Analyzing complex scenarios and providing recommendations
- Conducting risk assessments
- Problem-solving with multiple variables
- Strategic planning and decision-making

### Converting Information

Generative AI can generate content in one domain with input from another. This includes:

- Translating between languages (natural or programming)
- Converting data formats (e.g., JSON to CSV)
- Transforming natural language into structured queries
- Converting visual information into textual descriptions
- Transforming textual descriptions into visual representations

### Compactifying Information

Generative AI excels at information compression and summarization:

- Creating concise summaries of lengthy documents
- Extracting key points from meetings or discussions
- Distilling research papers into core findings
- Generating executive summaries
- Creating bullet-point highlights from detailed content
- Even creating lossless compression at a fundamental level!

??? important "At a fundamental level [Language Modeling Is Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10668.pdf) demonstrates 3x lossless compression of text and images."
    Uses either newly trained 200K-3M transformer models or pre-trained Chinchilla models and achieves impressive compression rates.

    Details on implementation are somewhat hidden.

### Finding Information 

Generative AI can understand and locate specific information:

- Searching through documents for precise data points
- Querying knowledge bases or databases
- Finding relevant information in large datasets
- Semantic search and relationship mapping
- Answer extraction from complex documents

### Taking Action

Generative AI can trigger and coordinate actions:

- Generating executable commands
- Orchestrating API calls
- Managing workflow automation
- Coordinating tool interactions
- Implementing decision outcomes

### Classifying and Predicting Information

While traditionally the domain of AI/ML, Generative AI can also perform:

- Sentiment analysis and classification
- Pattern recognition and prediction
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Risk assessment and evaluation
- Multi-label classification tasks

These activities can be combined to create more complex workflows, such as:

- Finding relevant information, reasoning about it, and taking appropriate action
- Converting information, compactifying it, and presenting insights
- Creating new information based on patterns found in existing data
