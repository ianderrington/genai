There are a host of challenges associated with the use of GenAI at multiple levels. These challenges may also be appropriately considered _risks_ to add weight to their importance.

At the base level [technichal challenges](#technichal_challenges) creating and using the GenAI such that it is wholly consistent and coherent 

At a higher level, the concerns for displacement and capture of people's jobs must be taken into consideration. With arguments both minimizing and amplifying the concern, estimates still have around 300 million jobs replaced by AI, [according to a Goldman Sachs report](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html). AT the same time GDP could be increased by 7% and lift productivity. It is still apparent that [upskilling](#upskilling) to enable people to work with AI as an enabling tool is important to consider. 

At nearly the highest level of challenge is to have GenAI that is Aligned for the betterment of humanity and our planet and not to its detriment with [dual use](#dual-use). Because of the expansive and moral-philosophical nature of this, as in what is defining 'betterment' it is difficult. Concretely, however, minimizing potential risks associated with GenAI, especially Autonomous Agents, are necessary to address at a functional level, both at organizations and within governments and the regulatory bodies that coordinate the two.

In general [ethical use](../../Using/ethically/index.md) of GenAI will necessarily address all or most of these challenges.

## Accuracy Challenges

### Hallucinations 
There are a number of issues related to modle accuracy that pose challenges for GenAI models. Most prominant among them are the effect of _Hallucinations_. Models hallucinate, by making up facts or sentences that have no reasoanble bearing to reality. 

[Some studies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14648.pdf) indicate that the halluciantion-rate is related to the frequency that a fact appears only once in a data set, and that calibrated models, like those that are pre-trained, are more likely to hallucinate than those that do not have calibrated next-token predictions. 




## Ethical Challenges

### Job displacement 
Because GenAI can perform tasks at a speedy rate. 

### Copywrite and IP

Related to job-displacement, the content created with GenAI remains in a precarious state with regard's to copyright and IP. While there are indications that content generated purely from AI may not be copyrighted (in the US), it is generally accepted AI can provide the basis for content that may be copyrighted. The evolution of this may take years of debate and resolution of laws to settle before confusion is fully settled.

### Dual Use
The technology may be found to have dual-use.
