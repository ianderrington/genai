## General Categories

### Summarization 

This can be used to summarize documents. 

Codebases:
- [Summarization with Langchain] https://github.com/EnkrateiaLucca/summarization_with_langchain A splendid view of a quick streamlit app that does PDF summarization. 

### Semantic Search

Embedding of an input has the niceness that semantic, or 'meaning' nearness can be found via distance calculations. This enables semantic search.
This is important for memory recall with imperfect inputs, and for action routing based. 

### Knowledge graph building

Codebases:
- [GPT for knowledge graphs](https://medium.com/@m-elbably/gpt-graph-a-simple-tool-for-knowledge-graph-exploration-70e0e3861716) and [Github](https://github.com/m-elbably/gpt-graph)

### Prose Generation

Here is a non-extensive list of useful manners to use LLM generation of prose generation:

- Cleaning up draft, or lower quality texts or notes
- Brainstorming and ideation 
- Providing an initial draft for human editing
- Generating summaries and executive summaries
- Creating descriptions and explanations
- Rewriting for different target audiences
- Expanding on key points 
- Improving flow and readability
- Adding examples and analogies
- Filling in missing details
- Extrapolating from key points
- Creating fictional scenarios
- Writing product descriptions
- Writing blog posts and news articles
- Writing stories and novels

## Code Generation

Very powerfully it can generate code to accomplish a task based on natural language input. This is very promising but still requires human oversight, due to the [challenge](./challenges.md) associated with using Automated AI systems without human input or oversight.

### Healthcare

- [Health system-scale language models are all-purpose prediction engines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06160-y) Uses LLM based system to integrate real time clinical workflows with note-writing and electronic ordering. Generally quite-performant and. a great indication of how they could be used to predict things such as readmission rates, and many other applications. 

### Chemistry

- [Grammar-Induced Geometry for Data-Efficient Molecular Property Prediction](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SGQi3LgFnqj) A quality framework using heirarchichal metagraphs to stitch-together molecular nodes resulting in leaves that are 'actual' molecules. Using graph neural-diffusion, it does amazingly well even with minimal data-sets (100 examples).

## Societal simulations

- [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf): 
  They gave 25 AI agents motivations & memory, and put them in a simulated town. Not only did they engage in complex behavior (including throwing a Valentine’s Day party) but the actions were rated more human than humans roleplaying.
