!!! quote "Open source is eating the world"

While a bit hyperbolic, the power open source is hard to disregard. Enabling effective complexity to built into and between companies, it provides a legal framework that has accelerated the evolution of software and opened it up for many to use.

Within AI, there is no exception, and it is potentially even more powerful. In discussions of a widely circulated memo that left Google, they describe how [Open-source will reduce the moats](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/4/no-moat/()) when it comes to AI.

As such, we emphasize the nature of this project is to interact and connect with open-source as effectively as possible, while relying on enabling the open-source community to create more effectively.

!!! important "What is open source AI?"
    According to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/deepdive/drafts/the-open-source-ai-definition-draft-v-0-0-5#:~:text=To%20be%20Open%20Source%2C%20an,including%20to%20change%20its%20output.), to be Open Source, an AI system needs to be available under legal terms that grant the freedoms to:
    
    * Use the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.
    * Study how the system works and inspect its components.
    * Modify the system for any purpose, including to change its output.
    * Share the system for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.
