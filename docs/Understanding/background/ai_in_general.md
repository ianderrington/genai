## Tools and Repositories

Being able to see the 'structure' of some neural networks make it easier to understand, and more aesthetic.  Please see
[PlotNeuralNet](https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet) and a nice [writeup](https://pub.towardsai.net/creating-stunning-neural-network-visualizations-with-chatgpt-and-plotneuralnet-adab37589e5) on how to use it.
