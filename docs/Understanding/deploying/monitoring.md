## Monitoring Gen()AI
For reasons related to quality, ethics, and regulation, it is both useful, and at times required, to record both inputs, and outputs from an LLM. Particularly in systems that may be used in non low-risk settings, monitoring is an essential component of Gen()AI.  Also known as _LLM observability_, monitoring can people-in-the-loop, as well as automated systems to observe and adapt the system to both inputs and outputs that are undesired or dangerous.
