## Ideas

!!! idea "Ideas are a dime a dozen."
    But if you don't have one, you won't find a cent.

Here are some ideas of things that might be explored particularly in conjunction with this. 

* A codebase watcher and executor agent for public codebases like in github. This would have a vector database + query  (+ build) system that would allow the code base to be queried and interacted with via 'execution' of various functions.  They would allow for tested execution of external codebases (and functions). Kind of like code interpreter but for not making new code but calling code that is already needed. This would allow code to use other code just as a person would.

* Ability to create docker images from repos: [repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker)
