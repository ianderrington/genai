#### Healthcare

- [Health system-scale language models are all-purpose prediction engines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06160-y) Uses LLM based system to integrate real time clinical workflows with note-writing and electronic ordering. Generally quite-performant and. a great indication of how they could be used to predict things such as readmission rates, and many other applications. 

#### Biology

- [Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic-level protein structure with a language model](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574) End to end Language model enabling structure sequence pairing, coupled with an equivariant transformer structure model at the end.

### Societal simulations

- [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf): 
  They gave 25 AI agents motivations & memory, and put them in a simulated town. Not only did they engage in complex behavior (including throwing a Valentine’s Day party) but the actions were rated more human than humans roleplaying.
