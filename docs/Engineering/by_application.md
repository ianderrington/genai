??? tip [Genome-wide prediction of disease variant effects with a deep protein language model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01465-0) "Model that predects bad genetic variants"
    Here we implemented a workflow generalizing ESM1b to protein sequences of any length and used it to predict all ~450 million possible missense variant effects across all 42,336 protein isoforms in the human genome.
