Here we provide selected references to frameworks and solutions surrounding AI in general

## Frameworks
Pytorch
Tensorflow

### Higher-level Frameworks
Higher level frameworks minimize the lines of code needed to make a model and keep track of everything. 

- [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) Framework for boiler-plate minimal ML calling using pytorch. Enabled [heirarchichal Attention networks](https://github.com/neuro-inc/ml-recipe-hier-attention)
- [Lightning + Hydra](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template) Uses the [lightning] framework with Hydra-based config management. 


## Must-have knowledge

## Network Figures

Being able to see the 'structure' of some neural networks make it easier to understand, and more aesthetic.
