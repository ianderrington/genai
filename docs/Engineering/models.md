There are a vast number of both open and closed-source models that can be used. A number of them can be downloaded and run on the appropriate hardware, others may be accessed through APIs. 

It is essential to [compare and evaluate](comparison_and_evaluation.md) the models for your intended use-cases to ensure they meet technical, customer, and organizational requirements. 


## Leaderboards and comparisons

Here are a few boards that help to aggregate and test models that have been released.
