## Welcome to [Managen.ai](https://www.managen.ai),

Working as a relevant information hub, Managing Generative AI will provide an expansive seed that will allow for us to keep up with the rapidly evolving technologies and techniques. 

## How to use

In [the section we are now in](./index.md) we discuss the Managen.ai project.
If you'd like to start building and using GenAI, we suggest heading over [here](../Understanding/index.md) where you can learn the deep and wide components of building Generative AI, and building _with_ Generative AI. \
With your Generative AI solutions coming together, we go over [effective, responsible, and ethical manners](../Using/index.md) of using the code.
