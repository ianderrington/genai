Using Github to organize our understanding of a fluid field is a notable challenge. Because of the acessibility of mkdocs-material it makes it easy to make nice-looking documentaiton, though sometimes without the niceties that could accompany other software systems. 

Eventually we may shift to other systems (like docusaurus). Before that though, we will be wanting to integrate state-of-the-art updates to understanding while we build our auto-building system. 

## Content
- [ ] Improve strructure of everything hello OK Obama
- [ ] Go through content that is already there read it, summarize it, and make it look better.


## Generative Building

- [x] Enable simple jupyter-notebook calls to improve documents.
    - [ ] Ensure all links are preserved.
    - [ ] Enable multiple LLM integration, for instance with Llama on OSX. 
- [ ] Enable automatic github PRs based on a continuous feedback system (Like Auto-GPT). 
- [ ] Enable vector-databasing and other RAG tools to function, focusing on 
    - [ ] individual github-repositories 
    - [ ] linked documents

## Visualization

We can make this easier to read

- [ ] Improve landing page and header bar to be more modern. 
- [ ] Build interactive graph representation of this site that includes summary information. Check [this out](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-network-graphs-interactive-with-python-and-pyvis-b754c22c270) and the [examples](../Understanding/examples/index.md)
- [ ] https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/06-Network-Analysis/02-Making-Network-Viz-with-Bokeh.html
- [ ] build with https://docusaurus.io/
- [ ] Integrate example python notebooks and build with https://github.com/outerbounds/nbdoc
