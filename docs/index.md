# 🎉 Welcome to Managing Gen()AI!

**Our Mission**: Simplify and demystify Gen()AI for making it accessible and understandable, and to increase our ability to manage it. 

Our **open-source project** on [**Managing Generative AI**](https://www.managen.ai) 🤖 will help us to stay on top of understanding and working with the increasingly complex of world of Generative AI.

## Why is it called Gen() AI?

Generative AI creates. So does will General AI. Depending on their definitions there may be notable differences, the overlap ensures that there will be shared characteristics that warrant writing this ambiguously, such as GenAI or Gen()AI. 

## 📘 What's Inside?

- **Understanding Generative AI**: Delve deep into the mechanics, models, and methodologies of Gen()AI.
- **Managing Generative AI**: This is the heart of our project, with tools to enable quality, and responsible development of this and other AI-projects.
- **Collaboration**: Written in **Markdown**, this documentation encourages community collaboration through **GitHub pull requests** 🤝.

## 🚀 GenAI Explaining Itself?

One of our ambitious goals is to have this documentation written and updated by **GenAI itself**. We aim to:

- 📝 Set up a **base documentation repository** that aids in generating self-descriptive content.
- 🔄 Implement an **automated merge and build system** for a seamless automation and viewing experience.
- 🔁 Create a **self-referential models** using tools like Langchain to enable its supervised self-improvement via pull-requests and reviews.
- 🕸️ Catch the greatest new insights and integrate it into a 'living' document that evolves with the time. 

We believe in Gen()AI's potential to effecively **explain itself** even as the technology grows with extreme complexity.
