# 🎉 Welcome to Managing Gen()AI!

**Our Mission**: Simplify and demystify Gen()AI for making it accessible and understandable, and to increase our ability to manage it. 

Our **open-source project** on [**Managing Generative AI**](https://www.managen.ai) 🤖 will help people to stay on top of understanding effectively working with the increasingly complex of world of Generative AI.

!!! important "Why is it called Gen() AI?"

    `Generative AI` creates. So does will `General AI`. Depending on their definitions there may be notable differences, the overlap ensures that there will be shared characteristics that warrant writing this ambiguously, such as GenAI or Gen()AI. 

## 📘 What's Inside?

- [**Understanding and Building GenAI**](./Understanding/index.md): Delve deep into the mechanics, models, and methodologies.
- [**Deploying GenAI**](./Understanding/deploying/index.md): Learn how to build and deploy models.
- [**Using GenAI**](./Using/index.md): Where we describe use cases and applications, commercial tools and applications, and the ethics and regulations surrounding GenAI.
- [**Managing GenAI**](./Managing/index.md): This is the heart of our project, where we describe the tools that we are building to enable quality, and responsible development of this and other AI-projects.

## 🚀 GenAI Explaining Itself?

One of our ambitious goals is to have this documentation written and updated by **GenAI itself**. We aim to:

- 📝 Set up a **base documentation repository** that aids in generating self-descriptive content.
- 🔄 Implement an **automated merge and build system** for a seamless automation and viewing experience.
- 🔁 Create a **self-referential models** using tools like Langchain to enable its supervised self-improvement via pull-requests and reviews.
- 🕸️ Catch the greatest new insights and integrate it into a 'living' document that evolves with the time. 

We believe in Gen()AI's potential to effecively **explain itself** even as the technology grows with extreme complexity.
