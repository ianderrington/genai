# Welcome!

It is a pleasure to share with you learnings made regarding modern Gen(erative) AI, or Gen()AI in this website. 

It is *open source* project to encourage thoughtful understandings  regarding the expanding and complex topic of Gen(erative) AI.

Written to be _full spectrum_ this will include many references to a number of topics. 

Because it is written directly in Markdown, and can be easily QCed via Github pull requests, a proximal and immediate *goal* of this object is to also have this project written by Gen()AI itself, to help keep up with the complexity of information. But we have to start somewhere!

Initial goals focus on the following will involve 

- Writing a base documentation repo that is generally useful and enables the Authors a greater capacity to create self-descriptive repositories.
- Enabling for merges to build the website automatically in a aesthetic and readable manner.
- Create a self-referential build system using Langchain and learned informations. This may involve variations of AutoPR, etc ... 

We know that this is just an initial test, but if we can have Gen()AI explain itself nicely, for many to read, then can *do more* with Gen()AI.

If you'd like contribute, please create a PR according to these [guidelines](this_project/contributing.md)!
