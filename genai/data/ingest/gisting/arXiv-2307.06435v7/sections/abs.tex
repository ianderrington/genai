% Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown excellent generalization abilities that lead to the development of numerous models. These models suggest different approaches, for example, increasing model parameters, training data, tweaking architecture, training strategies, and pipelines to outperform baselines. Analyzing these aspects is important to identify changes that bring stability to the training and better generalization for the LLMs. In this paper, we summarize these fine-grained details of LLMs. Initially, we provide a background for the LLMs to discuss basic building blocks followed by a comprehensive overview of LLMs. The end of the paper discusses important findings by the LLMs and summarizes important architectural and training strategies to develop better LLMs. Because of the continuous development in LLMs, we will update this paper regularly with new sections and LLMs.  

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown excellent generalization capabilities that have led to the development of numerous models. These models propose various new architectures, tweaking existing architectures with refined training strategies, increasing context length, using high-quality training data, and increasing training time to outperform baselines. Analyzing new developments is crucial for identifying changes that enhance training stability and improve generalization in LLMs. This survey paper comprehensively analyses the LLMs architectures and their categorization, training strategies, training datasets, and performance evaluations and discusses future research directions. Moreover, the paper also discusses the basic building blocks and concepts behind LLMs, followed by a complete overview of LLMs, including their important features and functions. Finally, the paper summarizes significant findings from LLM research and consolidates essential architectural and training strategies for developing advanced LLMs. Given the continuous advancements in LLMs, we intend to regularly update this paper by incorporating new sections and featuring the latest LLM models.
