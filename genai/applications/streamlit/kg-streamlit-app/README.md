# Advanced RAG Streamlit Chatbot - README 

This AI chatbot integrates a Spacy-LLM constructed knowledge graph with an advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), offering context-aware interactions. Built using Streamlit, it features an intuitive UI and a neo4j-like graph interface for exploring entity relationships. This chatbot is fed with data related to the OpenAI Saga.

Highlights

1. Advanced RAG System: 
Utilizes OpenAI's language models for relevant, informed responses.

2. Knowledge Graph Integration:
Leverages Neo4j's comprehensive network of entity relationships for deeper insights.

3. Streamlit Interface:
Offers a user-friendly, easy-to-navigate experience.

Note: retrievers.py and chain.py are from langchain's neo4j_advanced_rag template:
