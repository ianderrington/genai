    "Build a networked understanding pointing initially to a local set of files that may also link to a http:// . The resulting hyperlink may point to with even a pdf, image, or video. \n",

    "\n",
    "To effectively create a self-explaining AI that can also evolve, it needs to be able to explain all of the components that that make it up, or could make other AI up. This will require having explicit knowledge on a high-level, as well as on an implementation level related to open-source code databases. \n",

    "Using both regular algorithms (regEx) and AI (API calls) to create understanding graphs. \n",
