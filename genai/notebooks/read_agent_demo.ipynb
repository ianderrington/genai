The President revealed that the envoy spent his first day whistling and playing with a dog, cat, and mouse.\n",

Andersen faced the audience and announced that they would now hear from the first being to come to Earth from another world. Dameri Tass, the alien, was surprised and worried, realizing he had made a mistake. He confessed that he was not an envoy from another planet, but a collector of specimens for a zoo.

            "Model chose to look up page [6, 7, 8]\n",
            "Expanded shortened article:\n",
            " The first envoy from another world was about to speak, but he seemed more interested in a horse. Patrolmen Dermott and Casey approached the strange craft and encountered Dameri Tass, who spoke in a language they didn't understand.\n",
            "Dameri Tass emerged from his spacecraft with a strange contraption and tried to get the patrolmen to put on a metal cap. Despite their reluctance, they were instructed to humor him until officials arrived.\n",
            "Casey put on the cap and felt a shock, thinking he had been murdered. His friend explained that the cap was harmless and allowed him to understand their language. The patrolman made a comment about their Irish accents.\n",
            "Dameri Tass encounters a horse and then is taken to Washington, causing a major uproar.\n",
            "The United Nations demanded the alien be heard, and the White House yielded. The world was excited and eagerly awaited the visitor's message. It was the most universally awaited event of the ages.\n",
            "Nine-tenths of Earth's population was ready to be guided by the space envoy, while the other tenth was resistant. President McCord and Secretary-General Andersen were nervous about introducing the space emissary, who had been asleep for almost two weeks upon arrival. The President revealed that the envoy spent his first day whistling and playing with a dog, cat, and mouse.\n",
            " \"I wish we knew what he was going to say,\" Andersen worried. \n",
            " \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred. \n",
            " Surrounded by F.B.I. men, Dameri Tass was ushered to the speaker's stand. He had a kitten in his arms; a Scotty followed him. \n",
            " The alien frowned worriedly. \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all this be? Is it some ordinance I've been after breakin'?\" \n",
            " McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen hastened to reassure him and made him comfortable in a chair. \n",
            " Viljalmar Andersen faced the thousands in the audience and held up his hands, but it was ten minutes before he was able to quiet the cheering, stamping delegates from all Earth. \n",
            " Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall not take your time for a lengthy introduction of the envoy from the stars. I will only say that, without doubt, this is the most important moment in the history of the human race. We will now hear from the first being to come to Earth from another world.\" \n",
            " He turned and gestured to Dameri Tass who hadn't been paying overmuch attention to the chairman in view of some dog and cat hostilities that had been developing about his feet. \n",
            " But now the alien's purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was that last you said?\" \n",
            " Viljalmar Andersen repeated, \"We will now hear from the first being ever to come to Earth from another world.\" \n",
            " The face of the alien went a lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't jist be frightenin' a body, would ye? You don't mean to tell me this planet isn't after bein' a member of the Galactic League?\" \n",
            " Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic League?\" \n",
            " \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass moaned. \"I've gone and put me foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\" \n",
            " Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I don't understand! Do you mean you aren't an envoy from another planet?\" \n",
            " Dameri Tass held his head in his hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's sayin', and meself only a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo.\" \n",
            " He straightened and started off the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I must blast off immediately.\" \n",
            " Things were moving fast for President McCord but already an edge of relief was manifesting itself. Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of course, of course, if that is your desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard who had accompanied the alien to the assemblage. \n",
            " A dull roar was beginning to emanate from the thousands gathered in the tremendous hall, murmuring, questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen felt that he must say something. He extended a detaining hand. \"Now you are here,\" he said urgently, \"even though by mistake, before you go can't you give us some brief word? Our world is in chaos. Many of us have lost faith. Perhaps ...\" \n",
            " Dameri Tass shook off the restraining hand. \"Do I look daft? Begorry, I should have been a-knowin' something was queer. All your weapons and your strange ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn't yet established a planet-wide government. Sure, an' I'll go still further. Ye probably still have wars on this benighted world. No wonder it is ye haven't been invited to join the Galactic League an' take your place among the civilized planets.\" \n",
            " He hustled from the rostrum and made his way, still surrounded by guards, to the door by which he had entered. The dog and the cat trotted after, undismayed by the furor about them. \n",
            " They arrived about four hours later at the field on which he'd landed, and the alien from space hurried toward his craft, still muttering. He'd been accompanied by a general and by the President, but all the way he had refrained from speaking. \n",
            " He scurried from the car and toward the spacecraft. \n",
            " President McCord said, \"You've forgotten your pets. We would be glad if you would accept them as—\" \n",
            " The alien's face faded a light blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet, my name'd be nork . Keep your dog and your kitty.\" He shook his head sadly and extracted a mouse from a pocket. \"An' this amazin' little crature as well.\" \n",
            " They followed him to the spacecraft. Just before entering, he spotted the bedraggled horse that had been present on his landing. \n",
            " A longing expression came over his highly colored face. \"Jist one thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were they pullin' my leg when they said you were after ridin' on the back of those things?\" \n",
            " The President looked at the woebegone nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said, surprised. \"Man has been riding them for centuries.\" \n",
            " Dameri Tass shook his head. \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my makin' if I could've taken one back to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel. \n",
            " The others drew back, out of range of the expected blast, and watched, each with his own thoughts, as the first visitor from space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Instruction fine-tuning improves the model performance significantly with minimal computing, only 0.2\\\\% of the total pre-training compute in the case of PaLM 540B. Flan also suggests that adding more instruction fine-tuning tasks with CoT reasoning data will likely improve the performance further.   ',\n",
