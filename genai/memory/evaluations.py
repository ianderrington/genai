# This file enables the evaluations of memory. It will rely on needle in haystack search 
# evaluations, pulling random samples from the folder and references herein. 

# The abstracted input components will be the memory database, the query, the evaluation data, 
# and the evaluation LLM. 
# The evaluation data will be generated random extraction of data from the directory, and then from references. 
# The output will provide aggregated information that can be used to plot retrieval success.
